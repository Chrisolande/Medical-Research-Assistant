      "content": "We extracted data on patients who underwent EEP in 15 Centers (January 2019-January 2023). Continuous variables are expressed as medians and interquartile ranges while categorical variables as absolute numbers and percentages. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of overall postoperative incontinence and reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 731 patients were included. Median age was 82 years and median prostate volume (PV) was 90 cc. 33.1% of participants had PV ≤ 80 ml, 28.4%. between 81 and 100 ml, 36.7% between 101 and 200 ml, and 1.8% of more than 200 ml. Median International Prostate Symptom Score was 23 [20-26]. EEP was mainly performed with the en-bloc technique (367 cases, 50.3% of the total). Total median operation time was 80 min [60-110]. Postoperative urinary incontinence was reported in 113 patients (15.5%). Complication rate was low with only 16 patients (2.2%) suffering from major complications (sepsis: 1 case; bleeding requiring surgical control: 13 cases; secondary morcellation: 2 cases). At multi-variable analysis, PV > 200 ml was significantly associated with higher odds of incontinence (OR 5.84 95% CI 1.76-18.96), whilst en-bloc enucleation with lower odds (OR 0.51 95% CI 0.32-0.80). EEP in men aged 80 years and above is a safe, efficacious, and size-independent procedure. In glands larger than 200 ml there may be a prolonged period of incontinence, mainly stress-related. En-bloc enucleation may be a better approach to minimize early urinary incontinence.",

This research aims to systematically identify and analyse the barriers and challenges that hinder the widespread adoption and accessibility of AT and propose practical solutions to overcome them. A Systematic Literature Review (RSL) was employed as the primary methodological approach, followed by the application of VOSviewer and Statistica Software to ensure a rigorous analysis of the data and the formation of clusters of barriers, which were subsequently grouped to allow a standardised, didactic exploration and segmented of the similarities between the identified obstacles. The analysis identified thirteen clusters, the most prevalent in the literature being the \"Financial and Knowledge Access Barriers\". This study provides a comprehensive examination of the challenges obstructing the accessibility and implementation of AT, offering targeted strategies to mitigate these barriers and improve the integration of AT for its end users.",

In addition to MPFL reconstruction, we performed a rare osteotomy named combined distal femoral osteotomy (CDFO), which combined the characteristics of lateral opening wedge distal femoral osteotomy (LOWDFO) and derotational distal femoral osteotomy (DDFO). We report the case of a 52-year-old female with left knee pain, valgus, and instability who was diagnosed with patellar instability and valgus knee osteoarthritis. Considering the patient's relatively young age, a hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) of 194°, a mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) of 77.5°, a shortened left lower limb of 7 mm, an increased femoral anteversion angle (FAA) of 37.4°, and a patellar instability, we performed MPFL reconstruction and CDFO treatment. In this procedure, computer-aided design (CAD) combined 3D-printed osteotomy guide-assisted CDFO and MPFL reconstruction were performed.",

Two independent reviewers selected the studies and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 and Methodological index for nonrandomized studies score. Statistical analysis was completed by Revman 5.4. A total of seven trials with 341 participants entered our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that RA-DBS demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in target point error (MD: - 0.30, 95%CI: [-0.58, - 0.02], I2 = 0, p = 0.03) and deviation outliers compared to nRA-DBS. (OR: 0.15, 95%CI: [0.04, 0.51], I2 = 0, p = 0.002). RA-DBS and nRA-DBS demonstrated comparable efficiency metrics in terms of operation room time (MD: 19.37, 95%CI: [-62.85,102.59], I2 = 99%, p = 0.65), operating time (MD: - 17.04, 95%CI: [-84.95, 50.87], I2 = 98%, p = 0.62) and total anesthesia time (MD: 14.24, 95%CI: [-96.26, - 124.73], I2 = 97%, p = 0.80). Two groups were comparable in terms of complication rates (OR: 1.79, 95%CI: [0.79, 4.05], I2 = 5%, p = 0.17) and intracranial hemorrhage rates (OR: 0.80, 95%CI: [0.23, 2.74], I2 = 0, p = 0.72). RA-DBS exhibits efficiency and safety comparable to nRA-DBS, serving as a viable alternative to nRA-DBS. Although RA-DBS shows promise in accuracy, further high-quality studies are needed to establish its clinical superiority.",

      "content": "Patients are increasingly utilizing community pharmacy test and treat programs to diagnose and treat acute respiratory infections. There are several Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-waived point-of-care tests (POCT) available to quickly identify GAS. The objective of this article is to explore the 11 antigen and two molecular CLIA-waived GAS POCTs currently available in the United States (U. S.) and the studies that assessed their use in pharmacy test and treat programs. Nine studies evaluated their use in community pharmacy test and treat programs and support their use, especially for decreasing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and providing access to care for patients without a primary care provider or after regular business hours. As medication dispensing margins continue to shrink, community pharmacists continue to seek additional ways to serve their patients and develop new revenue streams. Additionally, test and treat services are a means to improve access to care and promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship. Recently, patients have expressed an increased willingness to receive care for various illnesses, including acute pharyngitis, at community pharmacies. Acute pharyngitis is well-suited for management in a community pharmacy since treatment recommendations are well established and straightforward. Overprescribing of antibiotics from traditional health care settings is higher than desired and pharmacy-based models have demonstrated the ability to decrease unwarranted antibiotic use. A pharmacy-based acute pharyngitis management model makes strong medical and business sense.",

      "content": "Congenital Cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading infectious cause of non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss and a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disability in infants. This narrative review aims to describe the mechanisms by which CMV disrupts fetal brain development in early gestation, the importance of neonatal neuroimaging in predicting prognosis, and the optimal intervention for preventing neurologic sequelae. We performed a literature search on PUBMED on this topic and selected the most relevant results, including studies describing neurologic outcomes, neuroimaging, hearing loss, treatment efficacy, or follow-up recommendations in infants with cCMV, prioritizing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and expert consensus guidelines. The pathogenesis of cCMV infection is the result of various mechanisms that the virus uses to replicate in the developing fetal central nervous system; the major cause of structural damage to the brain is aberrant migration of neuronal precursors. Recent literature stresses the importance of neuroimaging and the role of neuroradiologic scores to predict neurologic sequelae. The management of infants with isolated SNHL, especially those diagnosed after the neonatal period, remains controversial, though emerging evidence suggests a potential therapeutic window up to 12 weeks of age. Follow-up protocols should be tailored based on clinical presentation, with close audiologic and developmental surveillance. Despite recent advances, key knowledge gaps persist regarding the mechanisms of CNS injury, optimal screening for vestibular dysfunction, neonatal biomarkers of prognosis, and treatment indications for isolated SNHL. Targeted research and standardized follow-up models are essential to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. • Congenital Cytomegalovirus infection is the leading infectious cause of non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss and a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disability in infants. • Neurological complications remain the most significant contributors to morbidity in cCMV infection. • Beyond classical neurological manifestations, cCMV infected babies show a high prevalence of vestibular dysfunction; neurodevelopmental sequelae are frequent, including autism, attention deficit, and learning difficulties, and may occur even in asymptomatic cases. Neuroradiologic scoring systems proved to be predictive of developmental outcomes.",

This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the contribution of oxidative stress and insulin resistance in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, current therapeutic approaches to treat oxidative stress and insulin resistance in this age-related neurodegenerative disease will be discussed. AD is the most prevalent form of neurodegenerative disease and is marked at early stages by oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Results indicate that insulin resistance may be central in generating oxidative stress and exacerbating AD hallmarks. In turn, insulin resistance can be influenced by other factors, including amyloid beta (Aβ), impaired biliverdin-reductase A (BVR-A) activity, and the gut microbiota. Defective insulin signaling in the brain comes with consequences ranging from declined cognitive functions, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and increased Aβ production.",

Most studies were randomized trials (57%), followed by case series (17%), and case-control studies/systematic reviews (both 10%). Calcium dobesilate (CaD), was the most assessed VAD in DR (85%), DN (86%), and DPN (50%). CaD has shown significant improvements in DR and DN based on systematic-review data. Our findings suggest that VADs, in particular CaD, may represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with both CVD and DmVC. Medical recommendations for VADs prescription should consider patients' microvascular status, evidence about VADs, as well as the multi-modal treatment approach.",

Technology has also sped up communication. It can be hard to find space in conversations. I use different communication methods depending on the situation, my message, or the listener. Using my voice with patient, familiar communication partners is the best way to express myself. Talking to others can be a frustrating experience. Sometimes I ask others to revoice my words. Paid communication supporters are difficult to find, train, and retain. For messages to new communication partners, I pre-type my thoughts into my AAC. The robotic voice is not my voice. It is another piece of technology that highlights how differently we interact with the world. We can advocate for a world where all AAC users are valued and included by: designing technology that adapts to the needs of each user; funding qualified communication supporters; implementing stronger employment policies; creating access to AAC that goes beyond functional needs; building community; and educating communication partners to assume competence and be patient listeners.",

Data extraction and methodological quality grading was performed independently by two separate authors. Most included reviews found a statistically significant effect of music listening on anxiety and pain levels. All music interventions had high heterogeneity due to differing music types and characteristics. Music intervention by a certified music therapist and music preferences chosen by patients proved to have better results than listening to preassigned music. Music listening is a safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-implement intervention that can be used as a sole approach or complementary therapy to decrease anxiety and pain levels during the perioperative period.",

Specifically, inhalation exposure to AlNPs induces lung damage by promoting inflammatory infiltration, airway remodeling, septal thickening, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. AlNPs-induced liver damage is characterized by hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis, liver sinusoid congestion, inflammation, and fibrosis. AlNPs induces neurotoxicity resulting in neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, altered neurotransmitter metabolism, and subsequent adverse neurobehavioral outcome. In turn, immunotoxicity of AlNPs is characterized by promotion of systemic inflammation along with impaired phagocytosis. In addition to the toxicity exerted by Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>NPs itself, the observed toxic effects of AlNPs may be attributed to Al<sup>3+</sup> release from the particles with the subsequent induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, genotoxicity, cell cycle dysregulation, and cell death due to apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis. It is also evident that both the size and the form of AlNPs significantly affect its cytotoxicity.",

      "content": "This chapter discusses methods for preparing samples of bone and bone cells for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging is by far the most useful in the bone field, followed by secondary electrons (SE) and the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analytical modes. Samples may have detail in a 3D surface, or be topography-free, polished or micromilled, resin-embedded block surfaces, or resin casts of space compartments surrounded by bone matrix. Shipping wet bone samples between labs is best done in glycerol. Methods for cells include fixation, drying, looking at undersides of bone cells, and metallic conductive coating. Maceration with alkaline bacterial pronase, hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium or potassium hydroxide to remove cells and unmineralized matrix is described in detail. Attention is given especially to methods for 3D BSE-SEM imaging of bone samples. PMMA is recommended for embedding because it is easily micromilled or polished. Iodine vapor staining of PMMA blocks gives excellent histology for cells and unmineralized matrix with BSE-SEM. Making spatial casts from PMMA or other resin embedded samples is an important use of this material. Correlation with other imaging means, including confocal scanning light microscopy, point projection X-ray microscopy, microradiography and microtomography, is important. Cathodoluminescence (CL) mode SEM imaging is an alternative for visualizing fluorescent mineralizing front labels such as calcein and tetracyclines. Laser ablation microtomy allows preparation of samples as slides for any method of light microscopy combined with SEM.",

In Western countries, the idiopathic etiology associated with viral conditions is the most frequent, with a good prognosis under optimal medical treatment, however, other etiologies such as purulent, neoplastic or autoimmune present a worse prognosis with the need for specific treatments. Therefore, an adequate etiologic diagnosis is essential and risk stratification will also be key to detect those entities at risk of complications that require in-hospital diagnostic and therapeutic management. Individualized treatment is essential based on anti-inflammatory drugs with different therapeutic regimens depending on each etiology and form of presentation, but without forgetting a humanized and patient-centered approach to achieve results in health and quality of life for these patients.",

      "content": "The primary reservoirs of C. burnetii are ruminant livestock, particularly goats, sheep, and cattle, which shed the bacterium through birth products, such as the placenta, amniotic fluid, and other secretions. Human infections typically occur via the inhalation of contaminated aerosols during direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their birthing materials. Consequently, individuals living in or working near livestock environments are at elevated risk, making Q fever both a location- and occupation-related disease. Owing to its remarkable environmental resilience and extremely low infectious dose, C. burnetii is classified as a Category B bioterrorism agent by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These characteristics significantly complicate efforts to eradicate the bacterium and position vaccination as a key strategy for preventing human transmission. Although whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) are currently licensed for use in Australia, their widespread implementation has been hindered by their strong reactogenic responses in individuals with prior exposure to C. burnetii. This review provides an overview of past and current efforts to develop non-reactogenic C. burnetii vaccines and discusses possible approaches to enhance the efficiency and safety of these vaccines.",

Pilot and feasibility trials showed that mindfulness-based interventions were well received and provided feedback on adaptations. There was a lack of data to draw conclusions regarding non-mindfulness-based therapies.

All patients admitted for management of a DRFU between October 2016 and September 2021 at a tertiary hospital in Aotearoa New Zealand (AoNZ) were included and followed until September 2024. Patients were grouped according to renal function: intact renal function; renal impairment with baseline creatinine greater than 150 μmol/L; and requirement for dialysis. Rate of mortality and rate of major limb amputation (MLA) were calculated at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years. Kaplan-Meier probability estimates were utilised to compare the survival and amputation-free survival of the dialysis cohort to the non-dialysis cohort. R Version 4.4.1 and Python were used for statistical analyses. Seven hundred seventy-two patients were admitted for management of a DRFU, of whom 431 (59%) had intact renal function, 160 (27%) had impaired renal function, and 136 (18.7%) required dialysis. The median follow-up was 19.3 months. Patients in the dialysis cohort were younger, median age 64 years, compared to 70 years in the non-dialysis cohort. Mortality rates were significantly higher in the dialysis cohort at 1 (33.8% vs. 17.6%), 3 (58.8% vs. 37.9%), 5 (69.9% vs. 50.5%) and 7 years (87.6% vs. 64.4%) (p < 0.001) with median survival time of 27.1 months compared to 47.7 months (p < 0.001).

Patient-specific factors, such as underlying neurological disorders or reduced spinopelvic mobility, should be carefully considered by the surgeon when selecting implants and devising a treatment strategy. Furthermore, the range of market-approved implants offers a broad spectrum of preventive measures for dislocation in both primary and revision settings. Central to prevention is the precise and appropriate positioning of the implant, tailored to the patient's individual joint biomechanics. While tripolar acetabular systems are utilized in specific patient groups during primary surgery and revision procedures, constrained liners, should be reserved as a fallback strategy in exceptional cases. The occurrence of a THA dislocation constitutes a medical emergency, necessitating immediate radiographic evaluation and early reduction. In cases of a first-time dislocation, additional imaging may be warranted during follow-up, whereas recurrent dislocations mandate tomographic imaging to exclude malpositioning or loosening of the implant. This review summarizes the underlying causes and preventive strategies for THA instability, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for managing THA dislocations.",

      "content": "Exploratory qualitative study using semistructured interviews guided by a critical realist epistemology. Online interviews with South Australian families. Self-selected sample of 16 parents (94% mothers) and their children aged 8-12 years in primary school grades third through sixth (60% female) from public (75%) and private schools (25%) across medium (38%) and high (62%) socioeconomic backgrounds. Factors influencing preparation of a nutritious and low-waste school lunchbox. Data were analyzed inductively using a reflexive thematic approach to identify major themes. Three major themes were generated: (1) extrinsic factors and school environment structures, (2) intrinsic factors and a Hierarchy of Motivations, and (3) responsibility for change. External factors influenced familial lunchbox packing practices, whereas personal priorities shaped food and packaging choices. Families emphasized shared responsibility for improving nutrition and reducing packaging between parents, schools, and broader systems. This study provides updated insights into family lunchbox practices. Preexisting challenges in lunchbox practices deter prioritization of environmental sustainability. School-level initiatives should address barriers and leverage enablers to support families. Further research is needed to integrate nutrition and sustainability agendas and clarify responsibility for driving change.",

Non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTPs) was established as a distinct entity in the 2017 4th edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of Endocrine Organs due to its indolent clinical behavior and excellent prognosis. These tumors are characterized by a well-defined border, an exclusive follicular growth pattern, and PTC nuclear features. Molecularly, NIFTPs typically harbor RAS gene mutations, PAX8-PPARG rearrangements, or THADA gene fusions. In the 2022 5th edition of the WHO Classification, subcentimeter NIFTPs and oncocytic NIFTPs were introduced as new subtypes. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology, ultrasound features, histology/cytology, and molecular characteristics of NIFTP.",

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, ChiCTR.org.cn, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify studies investigating the mechanisms involved in the development of OLF. The selected studies were categorized based on the type of mechanism explored. Initialing factors were summarized in tables and figures, and the related content were discussed systematically discussed. The mechanisms underlying OLF formation primarily involve genetic background and modification, mechanical stress, osteogenesis-related proteins, non-coding RibonucleicAcid (RNA) and metabolism. However, clinical trials reporting the translational application of these existing mechanisms were scarce. The formation and development of OLF are multi-factorial, and the underlying mechanisms have been preliminarily elucidated. Future research should focus on the clinical application of these mechanisms. This review may provide a theoretical basis for the development of therapeutic agents and offer new perspectives further studies on OLF.",

      "content": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for tissue regeneration due to their multilineage differentiation potential and ability to secrete paracrine factors with immunomodulatory and angiogenic functions. Standard MSC differentiation protocols typically rely on two-dimensional (2D) or pellet culture models that are simple to use but not well-suited for translational or clinical applications. To promote better cell survival, tissue deposition, and differentiation of MSCs, a wide variety of three-dimensional (3D) biomaterial scaffolds and platforms have been developed that provide structural support and present a carefully defined set of biochemical and biophysical cues to cells. While biomaterials can guide cell behavior and promote desirable tissue regeneration outcomes, one remaining challenge in the field is inherent donor-to-donor variability in MSC behavior, phenotype, and differentiation capacity. Although MSCs are promising tools for regeneration, the influence of donor variability on MSC differentiation across culture models remains poorly understood. Previous studies typically use cells from a single donor or rely solely on standard culture models. To address these gaps, we compared MSCs from six human donors and assessed differentiation across chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic lineages using both standard (pellet or 2D) and 3D biomaterial-based culture models. Alginate hydrogels were used to assess chondrogenesis, while gelatin microribbon (µRB) hydrogels were used to evaluate osteogenesis and adipogenesis in 3D.",

However, the chemical and physiological mechanisms behind this effect are only partially known and the role of ruminant's microbiota is still unclear. To study the effects of pasture botanical biodiversity on rumen microbiota, fermentation parameters and milk composition of dairy cows, an in vivo experiment, including in vitro measurements, was carried out with two balanced groups of seven dairy cows each. After a 5-week pre-experimental period on a common permanent grassland plot, the two groups of cows grazed for 4 weeks (experimental period) on two plots characterised by contrasting levels of plant biodiversity: low diversity (LD; 19 species, mainly grasses) and high diversity (HD; 56 species, mostly dicots).",

The species richness (α-diversity) of bacteria and fungi in the rumen and faeces of the cows did not differ between treatments, contrary to the composition and relative abundance (β-diversity) of bacterial and fungal communities. In addition, during in vitro rumen fermentation, total gas production of HD herbage was lower compared with LD, probably because of the different chemical characteristics of the substrates and the partial inhibition of bacterial activity by tannins. Furthermore, methane production in vitro was reduced in the HD group compared to the LD one, as indicated by the higher CO<sub>2</sub>:CH<sub>4</sub> ratio. Thus, the differences in β-diversity may be explained both by herbage fibre and plant secondary metabolite contents. Plant tannins also protected dietary proteins from degradation, as indicated by the lower ammonia to CP ratio obtained in vitro in HD than in LD digesta. Comparable proportions of C18:3 n-3 were found in milk, despite the lower total fatty acid and C18:3 n-3 contents of the HD herbage. Plant secondary metabolites in the rumen could have partially inhibited the activity of ruminal bacteria responsible for the biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This study explains how grazing dairy cows on permanent grasslands rich in plant biodiversity helps transferring polyunsaturated fatty acids from herbage to milk and likely reduces methane and ammonia emissions by influencing ruminal and faecal microbiota thanks to plant secondary metabolites.",

Outcomes of interest (OoIs), effect sizes, certainty ratings, and execution times were systematically compared. Effect sizes were assessed both quantitatively, by transforming TUR metrics to Cohen's d and correlating them with TU®'s RTU metric, and qualitatively, through categorical classifications (trivial, small, moderate, large). Certainty levels were compared by mapping GRADE ratings and TU®'s sentiment analysis scores onto a common 0-1 scale.",

The average execution time per TU® project was 4 hours and 46 minutes, compared to estimated durations of 6-12 months for TURs. The Umbrella Collaboration® demonstrated high concordance with TURs, replicating 84.9% of the outcomes identified by TURs and identifying nearly five times as many additional outcomes. The experimental effect size metric (RTU) showed moderate agreement with conventional measures, and the certainty ratings derived from sentiment analysis correlated acceptably with GRADE-based assessments. While further validation is needed, TU® appears to be a valid and efficient approach for tertiary evidence synthesis, offering a scalable and time-efficient alternative when rapid results are required.

      "content": "We identified residents of a 27-county region of Minnesota and Wisconsin on January 1, 2020, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Rural-urban commuting area classifications were used to categorize addresses as urban core, large town, small town, or isolated rural. Diagnostic codes were extracted from the 4 years prior. Codes were grouped into cancer types by Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of rurality on cancer prevalence. Analyses were stratified by rurality, directly standardized by age and sex to the total 2020 US population using survey sampling weights and analytically adjusted by including indicator variables for non-White race, Hispanic ethnicity, and smoking status. We found a higher prevalence of Hodgkin lymphoma among isolated rural residents compared with urban residents (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.44). In addition, men in large towns had a higher prevalence of throat cancer compared with urban men (OR, 1.57 [1.03 to 2.39]). Rural women had a higher prevalence of colorectal (large town: OR, 1.32 [1.12 to 1.55]; small town: OR, 1.23 [1.00 to 1.53]), anal (isolated rural: OR, 2.22 [1.27 to 3.88]), and ovarian (large town: OR, 1.40 [1.09 to 1.78]) cancer compared with women residing in urban areas. Our findings underscore the importance of moving beyond the simple urban-rural dichotomy to address cancer disparities.",

Equitable access has gained attention thanks to the significant work done by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS). Although the focus was on low- and middle-income countries, developed countries also face challenges in providing equitable surgical care and, in fact, do not always meet the benchmarks set by the LCoGS yet still have acceptable outcomes. We sought to explore the current strategies aimed at improving and maintaining access to essential surgical care in rural and remote areas of OECD countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). We conducted a scoping review using MeSH terms. The search was performed on MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and was limited to English sources published between 1946 and January 10, 2025. Any strategy or intervention aimed at improving and maintaining timely access to essential surgeries in rural and remote areas of OECD countries. Six main categories of strategies were found: (1) resource distribution; (2) task sharing; (3) telemedicine; (4) surgical workforce; (5) training and education; and (6) prehospital system. Recognizing that developed countries, in fact, do not always meet the benchmarks set by the LCoGS yet still have acceptable outcomes highlights that specific strategies are important contributors to the reduction of disparities between rural and urban outcomes.",

      "content": "Electrical communication in the heart is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac function. Traditionally, gap junctional coupling between cardiomyocytes has been accepted as the primary mechanism governing electrical propagation in the heart. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that gap junctions are also present between different cell types in heterocellular structures and disruption of such gap junctional coupling can be associated with cardiac dysfunction. In addition to gap junctional coupling, ephaptic coupling has been proposed as another mechanism for electrical communication between cardiomyocytes. Reducing ephaptic coupling has been shown to have negative impacts on cardiac conduction. While the existence of ephaptic coupling between different types of cardiac cell is under investigation, a recent study suggests that ephaptic coupling at heterocellular contacts between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts may provide a proarrhythmic substrate in cardiac disease. In this review, we examine the current literature on electrical communication in the heart, including gap junctional and ephaptic coupling in homocellular and heterocellular contexts.",

We then qualitatively described the additional activities proposed. There were 246 safety concerns listed for the 15 medicines of interest: 85 important identified risks (34.6%), 81 important potential risks (32.9%) and 80 instances of missing information (32.5%). More than half (n = 9, 60%) of the reviewed medicines listed children and adolescents as the most common populations with missing information. Pregnant women (n = 8, 53%) and those with hepatic and renal impairment (n = 7, 47%) were also commonly listed as having missing information. Additional pharmacovigilance activities were proposed for two thirds of the medicines (n = 10, 77%) where missing information was listed. Only one third of the reviewed medicines (n = 5, 33%) had specific proposals or protocols listed in the current Australian Public Assessment Reports to address missing information. Our study identified important gaps in RMPs for commonly used biologic medicines at the post-market phase. Despite some medicines having an extensive market history, these safety concerns remain unaddressed. Regular monitoring and critical review of RMPs are recommended to prioritise post-market studies and address outstanding safety concerns.",

      "content": "Artificial incubation can be used to address a variety of mechanistic, ecological, and conservation questions related to the development of egg-laying animals in a warming climate. Artificial incubation of passerine eggs remains rare because their eggs can be highly sensitive to incubation conditions, causing it to be challenging to successfully incubate their eggs to hatch in captivity. The goal of this study was to describe a protocol to artificially incubate eggs of house sparrows (Passer domesticus), a widespread model species, and to provide a framework that can be used to develop protocols for artificial incubation of other passerine species. Since sufficient egg mass loss is necessary for proper development and can be related to hatching success, we monitored mass loss of eggs in natural nests in the field and used this information to inform and modify artificial incubation conditions. We found that eggs in our study population lost an average of 11.34% of their original mass across the incubation period, and that mass loss was greater later in incubation. To identify conditions promoting high hatching success, we tested incubation conditions of 36.9°C-37.4°C, 40-50% relative humidity (RH), and automatic and hand egg turning. We achieved 100% hatching success of artificially incubated eggs using a rocking incubator with automatic turning (90°/hour) and three 180° hand turns per day, incubation conditions of 37.36°C and 42.6% RH, and hatching conditions of 36.73°C and 57.9% RH. These conditions and the framework we provide to develop incubation protocols for other passerine species can be applied to better understand how changing environmental conditions are affecting the development of egg-laying organisms.",

The most common challenge in managing these patients was ineffective communication; it was difficult to obtain relevant clinical information for 52% of the cases. Other challenges included the degraded infrastructure, limited number of trained personnel and inefficient evacuation corridors. The conflict in Gaza and the lack of facilities to adequately cater to their ophthalmic needs expose children to the risk of developing amblyopia and long-term vision loss. Multifaceted actions are needed to increase access to specialized eye care for the children, including permanent ceasefire, opening of safe evacuation corridors, timely and safe provision of aid, and enhanced medical training for service providers.",

In addition to microglia, several other specialized macrophage populations are located at the borders of the CNS, including dural, leptomeningeal, perivascular, and choroid plexus macrophages. Collectively, these are CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), but how these cells maintain the balance between the segregation of the CNS and the information transfer between the CNS parenchyma and the peripheral system is not well understood. The interaction between the immune system and the CNS is a newly emerging field of study that focuses on the functions of resident microglia and specialized macrophages, including leptomeningeal, choroid plexus, and perivascular macrophages.

A total of 51 endometriosis cases and 51 healthy volunteers were genotyped for MTHFR (C677T) and MTR (A2756G) gene polymorphisms. Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequency of genotypes was analyzed by the Chi-square test and odds ratio for relative risk. The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT genotypes of MTHFR C677T were 17.65%, 54.90%, and 27.45% in cases and 64.71%, 15.69%, and 19.61% in controls, respectively. In addition, the frequencies of the C and T alleles were 46.92% and 53.08% in cases and 72.55% and 27.45% in controls, respectively. The T-allele and the CT and TT genotypes of the MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism were significantly associated with cases. No significant association with cases was observed for the MTR A2756G gene polymorphism. We conclude that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with endometriosis, but the MTR A2756G polymorphism was not associated with endometriosis patients.",

It offers unique advantages over conventional mechanical testing methods by providing spatially resolved properties, requiring minimal sample preparation, and allowing measurements under controlled environmental conditions. This comprehensive guide provides a practical framework for conducting reproducible nanomechanical measurements on soft matter using AFM. Readers will learn how to select appropriate AFM modes, choose and calibrate suitable cantilevers, prepare samples, and optimize measurement parameters for soft materials. Four operational AFM modes are described: intermittent contact mode, nanomechanical imaging, force modulation, and force spectroscopy. We detail their principles, mechanisms, and trade-offs while offering practical advice for experiment execution, data analysis, and result reporting.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of energy drink and fruit juice as a storage medium for an avulsed tooth in maintaining the PDL cell viability with dextrose normal saline (DNS), oral rehydration salt (ORS), and hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS). A total of 62 freshly extracted human teeth were divided into five experimental groups and two control groups. The positive and negative controls corresponded to 0-min and 8-h dry time, respectively. The experimental teeth were stored dry for 30 min and then immersed in one of five experimental media (HBSS, ORS, DNS, ENERGY DRINK, and FRUIT JUICE) for 45 min. The teeth were then treated with collagenase type III and trypsin for 10 min. The number of viable PDL cells was counted with a hemocytometer and analyzed. Statistical analysis showed that HBSS, ORS, and DNS had no statistically significant differences among them in maintaining the viability of the PDL cells but were significantly better than FRUIT JUICE. No statistically significant difference was found between ORS, DNS, and ENERGY DRINK in the number of viable PDL cells. HBSS, ORS, and DNS showed similar results within the parameters of the study, concluded that among the agents used ORS and DNS can be used as alternative storage media for avulsed teeth. FRUIT JUICE, ENERGY DRINK, and ORS could serve as short-term storage media if the other solutions are not readily available.",

      "content": "Nanoparticle superlattices present transformative opportunities for material design by enabling precise control over both nanoscale organization and composition; however, translating these assemblies into macroscopic constructs while preserving nanoscale order remains a critical challenge due to the incompatibility of traditional processing techniques with colloidal systems. This study introduces \"colloidal metallurgy,\" a framework for understanding and controlling defect evolution and densification in nanoparticle superlattices during colloidal sintering. We investigate the effects of pressure and temperature to elucidate mechanisms of particle transport, defect annealing, and densification as single-crystal colloidal assemblies coalesce into polycrystalline superlattices. Pressure-driven crystallite fracture is identified as the primary mode of densification, while temperature enhances particle mobility, enabling defect reduction and grain growth. A multistage sintering strategy employing high temperature annealing to grow grains and restore fracture-based capacity for densification was developed to produce dense (∼1% porosity) polycrystals with low defect counts, demonstrating a pathway for processing nanoparticle superlattices. By exploring the parallels and distinctions between atomic and colloidal sintering, this work establishes critical insights into the mechanisms governing colloidal material processing.",

Results showed that FA converted exchangeable iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) to a residual state, and CS reduced the reducible Cu and Zn concentrations. The FC transformed Fe, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb) and Cd from exchangeable and reducible states to oxidizable and residual states. At the 6% addition rate, the passivation efficiencies of FC for Fe, Mn, Pb and Cd reached 34.33, 9.98, 14.92 and 17.32%, respectively.

      "content": "They are also key elements leading to the pathological calcification of vasculature; however, we know surprisingly little about them. First characterized over 55 years ago, MVs are small membrane bound extracellular vesicles that provide an environment for the concentration of calcium and phosphate. This makes MVs the first step in producing calcium phosphate, leading to the nucleation of HA mineral within the extracellular matrix, the key process in biomineralization. In this review, we discuss the literature on MV biogenesis and explore their components in the context of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exosomes. We consider MVs in light of the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV2023). In doing so, we identify striking parallels in the biogenesis, contents, and roles of MVs and exosomes, opening opportunities for new avenues of research and understanding. We also explore the debate around whether MVs really contain HA, and propose emerging technologies, particularly in the field of imaging, to improve our understanding of MVs and galvanise research in the area over the coming years. By taking a closer look at MV biogenesis, we will be able to make use of the emerging technologies around EVs more widely, with the aim of fully understanding these vital vesicles and harnessing their potential therapeutic benefits.",

      "content": "For each dual-task testing condition, a mobility task (level-ground walking or obstacle-crossing) was performed concurrently with 1 of 5 cognitive tasks (serial-subtractions, category naming, clock test, auditory discrimination, and shopping-list recall). Each cognitive task involved low and high complexity levels, yielding 20 dual-task conditions in total. Dual-task effect (DTE = [single-task - dual-task]×<i>100</i>/single-task) on walking distance (mobility-DTE) and number of correct responses (cognitive-DTE) were calculated for each dual-task condition. ResultsMedium to large interaction effects were observed between cognitive task type and complexity on cognitive (<i>F</i> = 12.0-15.8, <i>P</i> < .001, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.12-0.15) and mobility performance (<i>F</i> = 3.2-5.5, <i>P</i> < .05, ηp<sup>2</sup> = 0.03-0.06) during dual-task level-ground walking and obstacle-crossing. Among the cognitive tasks, serial-subtraction had the greatest interference effect on both cognitive (Mean DTE = -9.2 to -21.5%) and mobility performance (Mean DTE = -18.7 to -19.1%). Overall, \"mobility interference\" (decrement in walking distance without a decrement in cognitive performance) was the most common dual-task effect pattern observed. ConclusionThe type and complexity level of the mobility and cognitive tasks interact to influence the degree and pattern of dual-task effects, with the serial-subtraction task inducing the greatest effect. Standardized assessments involving distinct cognitive domains are necessary for profiling dual-task interference during walking among individuals with chronic stroke.",

      "content": "Chemical proxies recorded by the teeth enameloid layers are used to interpret ecological and environmental parameters throughout the geological record. The use of these proxies relies on the assumption that biomineralization processes for enameloid formation have remained constant during shark evolution. Here, we test such an assumption by comparing the chemical composition at the nanoscale, using the technique of atom probe tomography (APT), of enameloid in modern and fossil shark teeth. Results indicate that there are clear differences in the chemistry at the core and inter-crystalline grain boundaries of fluorapatite crystals. These boundaries are enriched in strontium in all shark teeth, whereas there are differences in the distribution of magnesium, sodium, and iron. Teeth of the modern shark <i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i> have magnesium and sodium distributed at the inter-crystalline grain boundaries. Teeth of Eocene fossil sharks, <i>Striatolamia macrota</i> and <i>Macrorhizodus praecursor</i>, have a unique distribution of iron, at the inter-crystalline boundaries, and sodium, at the core of the crystals. This observation may indicate that biomineralization processes resulting in enameloid formation are not constant across the phylogeny of sharks. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that the enameloid content and distribution of magnesium, iron, strontium, and sodium are highly controlled by biomineralization processes. The role of magnesium and sodium seems to be similar in mammalian enamel and shark enameloid formation. Yet, nanoscale chemical differences, such as the presence of strontium in tooth enameloid, are likely associated to functional morphology.",

When the balance between caregiving burden and support resources is disrupted, it becomes almost inevitable for mothers to experience burnout.

The sample of our study consisted of 80 mothers who presented to psychiatry clinics with burnout complaints and 80 healthy controls. Data collection tools included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Parenting Stress Index, and the Spousal Support Scale. Scale scores were compared between the groups. The mediating role of the Spousal Support Scale (SSS) in the relationship between the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was tested using path analysis. No statistically significant age difference was found between the two groups (p > 0.05). The number of children among participants in the burnout group was higher (p = 0.018). In the burnout group, a positive and statistically significant relationship was found between the total scores of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) (r: 0.664; p: 0.000), and a negative and statistically significant relationship with the total score of the Spousal Support Scale (SSS) (r: -0.409; p: 0.000). The indirect effect of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) through the Spousal Support Scale (SSS) was found to be statistically significant ( [Formula: see text] = -0.3294, p < 0.001).",

After participation in a faculty development program, a teacher team implemented new activities, the supervisors were grouped in pairs for support; a workshop was created for sharing experiences; and a video about feedback was produced. To explore and describe supervisors' perceptions of workplace-based interventions to develop quality in supervision in a clinical learning environment, we posed the research question: How did physiotherapy supervisors perceive the interventions during their supervision? A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected using focus group interviews with clinical physiotherapist supervisors (n = 12) and analyzed with inductive qualitative content analysis. One overarching latent theme was identified: an integrated and structured pedagogical approach was key to manage clinical learning. Three categories were identified: The teacher team contributed to structure and a sense of coherence, increased opportunity for collegial collaboration, and clarification of tasks and roles decreased experience of stress. The teacher team and the learning activities implemented contributed to an integrated pedagogical approach where collegial collaboration was beneficial for both new and experienced supervisors. Through the testing of new approaches, the clinical supervisors reported that their educational work was made more visible and attractive and that the well-functioning organization made a difference.",

Although the distinction between these patterns has long held for plants and animals, microbial community dynamics can blur the line between ecological and evolutionary processes, especially as they can occur on very similar timescales. Despite the importance of differentiating changes occurring within a population or strain from those occurring among populations, many common methodologies used to study microbiomes are not able to differentiate among them. In this review, we summarize the forces known to generate genetic diversity in bacterial genomes and describe the approaches used to study bacterial evolution from simple to more complex systems. We then explore how current methodologies and conceptual understanding can be applied to both understand and differentiate between the ecological and evolutionary processes in microbial communities. By highlighting lessons from longitudinal microbiome studies and experimental evolution, we explore the unique opportunities afforded by newer sequencing approaches and better sequencing resolution. Throughout, we identify the unique and outstanding challenges in studying these processes in microbiome systems and emphasize the great benefits in doing so to move forward our ability to better predict and manipulate microbiomes.",

The United States and its universities are leading research efforts on preoperative and intraoperative anxiety. Relevant journals in the four fields of anesthesia, pain, pediatrics, and nursing are the main journals in this direction. Studies on preoperative and intraoperative anxiety were divided into five categories, each replaced by different keywords. Over time, research on anxiety reduction has gradually shifted from diseases, surgical methods, and patient cognition to modern high-tech technologies such as music and virtual reality.

Python programming language was used to implement the CNN-based classification model. Cross validation was applied. A total of 72 plain periapical radiographs of 108 fractured teeth were collected. The model achieved high accuracy in differentiating uncomplicated crown fractures from complicated ones (96.0%), from crown-root fractures (99.1%) and from root fractures (98.7%). Furthermore, the complicated injuries were distinguished from crown-root fractures and from root fractures with accuracy levels at 96.3% and 97.2% respectively. The model's overall accuracy in recognising the four classes was 78.7%. The proposed model showed excellent performance in the classification of dental fractures. The application of AI in paediatric dentistry, particularly in the field of dental trauma, is innovative and highly relevant to current trends in healthcare technology. Expansion of the current model to a larger dataset that includes the various types of injuries is recommended in future research. Such models can be a great asset for the less-experienced dentists in making accurate diagnosis and timely decisions.

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form was used to assess PA and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30) to assess HRQoL. Changes over time were analyzed using generalized estimating equations or linear mixed models. Associations between PFD with PA and HRQoL were analyzed using logistic regressions and analyses of variance. Of 126 participants, median age 63 years, most had endometrial (69%) and/or stage 1 cancer (72%) and underwent total hysterectomy (65%). Pre-surgery, 39% met PA guidelines, increasing to 53% 3 months post-surgery (+14%, 95% CI 2-25). Mean global health status/QoL domain scores from the QLQ-C30 did not change significantly (+4.4/100 points, 95% CI -0.8 to 9.6). Three months post-surgery, whether participants met PA guidelines was not associated with PFD.

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. A consecutive series of 80 patients with RLE were enrolled and randomized to the PRP group (arthroscopic ECRB repair followed by 1 PRP injection; n = 40) and the control group (arthroscopic ECRB repair alone; n = 40). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess tendon healing at 3, 6, and 12 months. The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) scale, range of motion, and muscle strength were evaluated at preoperative and follow-up points. The time to return to work was also compared between the 2 groups. Patients and assessors were blinded to the intervention. A total of 80 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled between July 2020 and July 2023, and 73 patients completed follow-up. The PRP group contained 35 patients, 11 men and 24 women, with a mean age of 47.8 ± 8.8 years. The control group contained 38 patients, 13 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 44.5 ± 5.8 years. No significant differences were found in magnetic resonance imaging classification and functional scores between groups at preoperative and follow-up periods. VAS, MEPS, DASH, and PRTEE scores and muscle strength showed significant improvement at 12 months in both groups (<i>P</i> < .001). However, the PRP group showed a significant improvement in grip and wrist extension muscle strength at 6 weeks postoperatively (<i>P</i> = .008 and <i>P</i> < .001, respectively), whereas the control group did not (<i>P</i> = .583 and .056). No complications were associated with PRP injection. PRP used as an adjuvant to ECRB repair did not show a difference in tendon healing and functional outcomes compared with ECRB repair alone for RLE at 12-month follow-up. However, PRP treatment showed a difference in muscle strength at 6-week follow-up compared with ECRB repair alone. NCT04556825 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

For nitrothal-isopropyl and endosulfan adsorption, the Freundlich isotherm model was suitable. MCG-DETA can serve as a potential low-cost adsorbent to remove nitrothal-isopropyl and endosulfan organic pollutants from wastewater. According to density functional theory calculations, electrostatic interactions between nitrothal-isopropyl and endosulfan with modified coffee grounds were verified. DFT calculation reveals that the calculated adsorption energy of nithrothal-isopropyl is -0.349 eV which is greater than that of endosulfan, -0.219 eV. The highest possibility of the attraction between modified coffee grounds and nitrothal-isopropyl was between -COOH in modified coffee grounds and -NO<sub>2</sub> in nitrothal-isopropyl. In addition, the attraction of modified coffee grounds and endosulfan is due to the COOH and NH<sub>2</sub> in modified coffee grounds and sulfonyl and halide in endosulfan. This effort enhanced researchers' thoughtfulness in the elimination of the mentioned organic pollutants from wastewater by using MCG-DETA nanocomposites experimentally and theoretically via density functional theory.",

This study investigates the association between postmortem neuropathologies and retrospective Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) findings across the Alzheimer's dementia continuum. This study utilized tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to investigate structural brain changes associated with AD neuropathology. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed, including MRI scans and neuropathological findings from 98 participants. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between TBM indices and neuropathological outcomes. The diagnostic performance of TBM was evaluated using accuracy analysis. Significant differences in TBM indices (StatROI and TempROI) were observed between the dementia and non-dementia groups. Logistic regression indicated that higher StatROI and TempROI indices were associated with lower odds of AD pathology, such as amyloid plaques (OR = 0.939 and 0.927), neurofibrillary tangles (OR = 0.961 and 0.931), and neuritic plaques (OR = 0.943 and 0.916).",

      "content": "This pattern was more evident in bacteria and more clearly exerted by land use than by climate. Bacterial R:B ratios decreased with land use in the following order: croplands > woodlands > grasslands. Fungal R:B ratios decreased as follows: grasslands > croplands > woodlands. Climate was found to interact with land use. In this way, arid climate tended to increase bacterial R:B ratios in the different land uses; however, the agricultural practices associated with croplands seem to buffer this effect. In fungi, the interactive effect of land use and climate was less straightforward than for bacteria. According to our models, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) in bacteria and SOC in fungi were identified as the primary predictors of R:B ratios. Therefore, factors related to climate and land-use change with impact on SOC and N contents are potential disruptors of soil microbial R:B ratios. This study clarifies the diversity:biomass relationships across different land uses and climates.",

Patient demographic data, operation performed, and follow-up complications were collected for review. Descriptive statistics, bivariate logistic regression, data normalcy, and appropriate tests of significance were used to compare the rate of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) and wound dehiscence across the 2 groups. ResultsA total of 1242 patients met our criteria: 863 were closed with nylon sutures (69.5%) and 378 with polyglactin 910 (30.5%). There was no difference between wound complications (3.18% vs 3.69%, P = .645), wound dehiscence (1.35 vs 2.82%, P = .122), or unplanned return to operating room (infection 1.08 vs 0.587%, P = .353 and dehiscence, 0.811 vs 1.52%, P = .314) between suture types. ConclusionThis study demonstrates no significant difference in wound complication rates after foot and ankle operations between those closed with polyglactin 910 and nylon sutures. With the potential benefits to clinic efficiency and decreased patient burden with absorbable suture use, this suggests a role for polyglactin 910 suture closures in foot and ankle surgery.

The comparative statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and the independent samples t test. Statistical significance was considered to be p < 0.05. A total of 60 patients were included, with 30 patients (age range 19-36) in group 1 and 30 healthy controls (age range 19-41) in group 2. Group 1 had a significantly higher I-QOL score (median 55, range 20-108) than group 2 (median 5, range 1-25; p < 0.001). FSFI score was significantly lower in group 1 across all domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain (p < 0.05 for all). The total FSFI score was also significantly lower in group 1 (16.21 ± 2.38) than in group 2 (24.50 ± 3.97; p < 0.001). Additionally, group 1 had a significantly lower median SES score (11, range 5-20) than group 2 (17, range 8-29; p < 0.001).

These are useful in defining how loading modulates (re)modeling and allow examination of the mechanisms that coordinate these events. This chapter describes how to apply mechanical loading to murine bones through points of articulation, which allows changes in endosteal, periosteal as well as trabecular bone to be revealed at multiple hierarchies, by a host of methodologies, including double fluorochrome labeling and computed tomography. In some instances, we consider how loads can be applied in order to allow responses in other components of the skeletal system to be examined.",

The introduction of catechol molecules in HPCS-C enhanced tissue adhesion, while the incorporation of CC nanoparticles also promoted the aggregation of blood cells to form a thrombus, enabling the hydrogel to rapidly establish a robust hemostatic barrier in various complex wounds. As a result, the HPCS-C/ODEX/CC hydrogel reduced bleeding in liver and tail hemorrhage models by 84.11-94.34% and 70.12-92.37%, respectively. The hydrogels also exhibited excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial, antioxidant, and wound healing promoting properties.

Although the use of carbon dioxide being well investigated in literature for standard EVAR, there are a few evidence about its use in F/BEVAR. The potential damage to kidneys is not only related to the procedure alone but also to the need to perform computed tomography angiography in the preoperative and postoperative period. With the aim to reduce the damage to renal function in patients with preexisting renal impairment, we report our experience of a total iodine contrast-free protocol in 6 patients with chronic kidney disease (stages from 3 to 5) who require a complex endovascular aneurysm repair due to an aneurysmatic disease of the thoracoabdominal aorta.

All the procedures were carried on with CO<sub>2</sub> as contrast medium. During follow-up, every patient underwent plain-computed tomography scan at 1 month and then duplex ultrasound evaluations. Technical success was achieved in all cases. There were no aneurysm or procedure-related complications related to the use of CO<sub>2</sub> in the perioperative period. At 6 months, in each case, the sac was stable and no endoleak were found. Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate values were similar to preoperative ones both in the perioperative period and during follow-up. The total iodine contrast-free protocol showed its feasibility and safety to carry on complex endovascular procedures in patients affected by chronic kidney disease from stages 3 to 5 and concomitant aneurysmatic disease of the thoracoabdominal aorta. This protocol could also avoid further deteriorations of renal function that could lead those patients to hemodialysis. A large cohort of patient and an extended follow-up are required in the future to achieve more accurate data. Clinical ImpactThis study aims to evaluate an iodine-contrast-free protocol for patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing complex endovascular aortic repair, such as FEVAR or BEVAR. The use of this protocol may help preserve renal function and prevent further deterioration in patients at high risk for acute kidney injury or hemodialysis. Although the literature describes the role of CO<sub>2</sub> as a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent, there are no reported experiences involving both preoperative and postoperative evaluation without the use of iodine-based contrast media.",

Only a few human studies have investigated the effect of AASs on tendon tissue, and to our knowledge, there are no data on female sex. The purpose was to investigate the effect of current and former abuse of AASs on the patellar tendon (PT). It was hypothesized that AASs would not affect tendon tissue. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. This study included recreational athletes with current (female: n = 4; male: n = 18; total: n = 22) or former (female: n = 5; male: n = 7; total: n = 12) AAS abuse and nonusers (female: n = 5; male: n = 9; total: n = 14). The authors investigated the proportion of tendon injuries, PT cross-sectional area by magnetic resonance imaging, mechanical properties by ultrasound, gene expression levels of connective tissue proteins, and cell density by histological staining from tendon biopsy samples. The combined AAS group (both current and former abusers) reported a higher proportion of upper body tendon injuries compared with nonusers (79.4% vs 28.6%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .002). There was no difference in PT cross-sectional area (<i>P</i> = .918) or cell density (fascicular matrix: <i>P</i> = .413; interfascicular matrix: <i>P</i> = .982) between current AAS abusers, former AAS abusers, and nonusers. There was a greater expression of IGF-1 mRNA in current AAS abusers compared with nonusers (<i>P</i> = .043), but there were no group differences in other mRNA targets. Former AAS abusers had significantly higher tendon deformation (<i>P</i> = .030) and strain (<i>P</i> = .026) at common force compared with nonusers. There were no significant differences between male and female participants in the effect of AASs on tendon tissue. These data show that the PT itself was not severely affected by AAS abuse.",

The B-mode ultrasound is useful for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of ocular diseases such as cataracts. Elastography is an ultrasonographic technique that allows the detection and measurement of tissue stiffness. This observational cohort prospective study aimed to determine the feasibility, reproducibility, and repeatability of 2D-shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) of lenses in horses. Forty-six eyes of 23 horses with no evidence of ocular disease were included in this study. The horses underwent an ophthalmic examination to ensure that they were healthy. After the B-mode ultrasound examination, 2D-SWE was performed by two operators with different levels of experience in diagnostic imaging. Elastographic images were independently analyzed quantitatively by two observers by measuring the shear wave velocity (m/s) and Young's modulus (kPa). Considering both right and left eyes, the mean shear wave velocity was 4.08 ± 0.71 m/s, and the mean Young's modulus was 51.30 ± 19.02 kPa.",

DBDPE and/or MPs impaired testicular morphology, sperm malformation rate, oxidative stress levels, and apoptosis. Our results of transcriptomics from GC-2 cells indicated that DBDPE and MPs lead to changes in oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, DBDPE and/or MPs exposure inhibited the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1- NF-E2-related factor 2 (Keap1-Nrf2) signaling pathway. Moreover, the combined treatment of MPs and DBDPE exerted an antagonistic effect on the reproductive system of mice. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of joint action in reproductive toxicity in mammals due to the combined exposure to MPs and DBDPE.",

Outcomes were assessed using a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) at three time points: at baseline before the intervention (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and four weeks after intervention cessation (T2). These assessments included the latency of wave V in brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), Penetration and Aspiration Scale (PAS), and Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale (VDS). The swallowing improvement of BSG and CSG were showed significantly greater than SSG (p < 0.05), while the ISG exhibited no significant differences in the DOSS and total VDS scores (p > 0.05). Furthermore, some sub-items of the VDS were lower than those in the SSG (p < 0.05). The latency of wave V in BAEP of ipsilesional and contralesional was synchronized and shortened in the BSG at T1 and T2; similar results were observed in the CSG at T2. In contrast, in the ISG, only the latency of ipsilesional V was shortened at T1 and T2 (p < 0.05). The results of the present study provide evidence that 3 Hz rTMS is more effective than traditional dysphagia therapies when applied to the bilateral and contralesional motor cortices, especially bilaterally over the cortical areas projecting to the mylohyoid muscles. Functional recovery was observed after real rTMS compared to the SSG, with the effects persisting at T2.

Development of the training materials included identifying learning objectives, developing a consistent training template, creating and refining session content and presentations, and obtaining feedback from the study's Community Advisory Board. The vaccine champion training included six 1-h live sessions delivered virtually. In addition to the availability of on-demand training session recordings, additional resources for champions included a study website, optional office hours with study team members, and a group channel to collaborate and connect with other champions. Evaluation of the training included pre- and post-session surveys (n = 5-8) and qualitative interviews (n = 4) after implementation of all components. Knowledge increased between the pre- and post-session surveys, indicating that champions understood the trainings. Evaluation of the specific champion tasks showed an increase in the champions' perception of their ability to successfully carry out the required tasks after completion of the training. During qualitative interviews, champions reported the training was comprehensive and helpful in remembering study-related tasks. The training and lessons learned presented in this study can be used to inform the development of trainings for champions in future intervention studies.",

      "content": "Owing to continuous exposure to environmental carcinogens, the oral cavity is a common site for malignant epithelial neoplasms in the head and neck region, with tongue cancer being particularly prevalent. Tongue cancer tends to exhibit aggressive behaviour, often resulting in recurrence and lymph and distant metastasis. CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family, plays a crucial role because of its membrane-dependent effects. Its biological activities include cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, growth, signal transduction and differentiation. CD9 was overexpressed and knocked down in tongue cancer cells (SAS cells). Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation, and gene and protein expression analyses were performed. Protein-guided docking and normal mode analysis were performed to study the interaction between CD9 and EGFR. The proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation ability significantly increased in CD9 + + cells. The expression of EGFR, p-EGFR, Akt, p-Akt, Bcl2 and MMP1 also increased significantly in CD9 + + cells, whereas the expression of bak and caspase3 increased in CD9-KD cells. This finding implies that CD9 regulates the expression of EGFR. CD9 is crucial for the insertion of EGFR into the plasma membrane. Loss of CD9 decreases the number of EGFRs on the cell surface, thus attenuating the signalling pathway required for cancer progression. As CD9 is very important for the function of EGFR, targeting CD9 could be an alternative therapy in the context of chemoresistance to EGFR-targeted therapy.",

In contrast, Raman spectroscopy has increased sensitivity for the main chemical components found within sporopollenins. We compare the classification performance and chemical information provided by FT-IR and FT-Raman using a large dataset of <i>Quercus</i> L. pollen, comprising five species in three sections: (i) <i>Cerris</i>: <i>Q</i>. <i>suber</i>, (ii) <i>Ilex</i>: <i>Q. coccifera</i>, <i>Q. rotundifolia</i>, and (iii) <i>Quercus</i>: <i>Q.",

      "content": "robur</i>, <i>Q. faginea</i>). Here, we used multiblock sparse partial least squares discriminant analyses (MB-sPLS-DA) analyses to directly compare the two infrared methods. Both FT-IR and FT-Raman successfully classified <i>Quercus</i> pollen to section level (100% accuracy). At the species level our models achieved ∼90% accuracy for FT-Raman and FT-IR separately and in the combined multiblock model. The multiblock results showed an increased number of sporopollenin peaks observed in FT-Raman spectra as compared to FT-IR. These peaks are also of a higher importance for classification. Results also showed differences in the types of vibrations that are of diagnostic value for the two infrared methods. CH<sub>2</sub> deformations are more important in FT-Raman, while C-O-C, C-O, and C = O stretches are more important for FT-IR-based identification of pollen. These vibrations are indicators of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. FT-Raman provides equally successful diagnostic potential to FT-IR, but uses more chemical information based on variations in sporopollenin chemistry than FT-IR. We suggest that the combined analysis of FT-IR and FT-Raman using multiblock analysis has great potential for classification.",

Reliable gustatory testing is relevant for researchers and clinicians, emphasising the need for reproducible measuring methods. This study aimed to provide normative data on the Taste-Drop-Test (TDT), which is already used in clinical and research settings. The TDT was administered to 424 healthy participants and 134 patients with gustatory dysfunction. The test consisted of liquid concentrations of four basic tastes: acidic, sweet, salty and bitter. After application, a test score was calculated for each individual. In the healthy participants, a significant correlation was found between TDT score and olfactory function. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found for superior taste function for younger age and female sex. The cut-off value based on the tenth percentile in the healthy participants was 6.25. The TDT can distinguish between normo- and hypogeusia. We recommend using the TDT to researchers and clinicians when an accurate measurement of gustatory function is warranted.",

In shoulder arthroplasty, ML accurately predicts postoperative outcomes, complications, and implant selection, facilitating personalized surgical planning and cost optimization. Predictive models, including ensemble learning methods, achieve over 90% accuracy in forecasting complications, while neural networks enhance surgical precision through AI-assisted navigation. In RCTs treatment, ML enhances diagnostic accuracy using deep learning models on magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, achieving area under the curve values exceeding 0.90.

However, several limitations persist, including antigen scarcity, immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments, and T-cell exhaustion. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has enhanced CAR-T potency by knocking out immune checkpoints (PD-1, CTLA-4) and improving persistence, while RNA interference (RNAi) silences immune-evasion genes (e.g. SOCS1). Nanozyme-based delivery systems enable precise CRISPR-Cas9 delivery (> 70% editing efficiency) and tumour targeting, overcoming instability and off-target effects. Innovations like SUPRA CARs, armoured CAR-T cells (e.g. IL-12/IL-21-secreting TRUCKs), and dual checkpoint inhibition synergize to reprogram the tumour microenvironment, reducing relapse by 40% in trials. Despite progress, high costs, manufacturing hurdles, and ethical concerns (e.g. germline editing risks) remain critical barriers. Emerging solutions include universal off-the-shelf CAR-Ts, hybrid nano-CRISPR systems, and AI-driven design, paving the way for scalable, personalised immunotherapy. This review highlights breakthroughs in CRISPR, RNAi, and nanotechnology, underscoring CAR-T therapy's transformative potential while addressing translational challenges for broader clinical adoption.",

Quantitative analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata. LL-BFRT showed a significant positive effect on muscle strength, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.70 (<i>p</i> < 0.00001, 95%CI: 0.49, 0.92, I2 = 42%, <i>p</i> = 0.07). In terms of pain reduction, LL-BFRT significantly lowered the outcome of visual analog scale (VAS), with an SMD of -0.60 (<i>p</i> < 0.00001, 95% CI: -0.85, -0.36, I2 = 0%, <i>p</i> = 0.44). LL-BFRT effectively improves muscle strength and reduces pain in patients recovering from knee injuries postoperatively. It presents an alternative rehabilitation method for patients who are unable to perform high-intensity resistance training.",

      "content": "Recognising side effects in this population can be challenging while they can negatively impact the quality of life. An accurate screening instrument is crucial to identify side effects of psychotropic medication in people with intellectual disabilities. For this purpose, the Matson Evaluation of Drug Side Effects (MEDS) is the most reliable and well-researched instrument. We translated the MEDS into Dutch, considering that the Dutch version of the MEDS must be accurate and aligned with its intended meaning, avoiding multiple interpretations; this study aimed to assess its intrarater and interrater reliabilities in people with intellectual disabilities using psychotropic medication. A certified medical translation agency performed translation and back-translation of the MEDS. Two researchers administered the MEDS three times on the same day. Participants were people with intellectual disabilities using psychotropic medication. Demographic and medical data were collected via questionnaires. Scoring and calculation of total domain scores, severity domain scores, duration domain scores and composite scale scores followed the MEDS manual. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals of these scores were used to assess intrarater and interrater reliabilities. The study sample included 40 adults with intellectual disabilities. Intrarater reliability was good to excellent for total domain scores (ICCs ranging from 0.873 to 1.000) and excellent for the total composite scale score (ICC = 0.945). Interrater reliability was moderate to excellent for total domain scores (ICCs ranging from 0.713 to 0.922) and good for the total composite scale score (ICC = 0.894). This study demonstrated moderate to excellent intrarater and interrater reliabilities for the Dutch version of the MEDS. This confirms its potential as a valuable instrument for clinicians to identify and monitor side effects in people with intellectual disabilities using psychotropic medication. We recommend the use of the Dutch version of the MEDS in both Dutch clinical practice and research for this purpose.",
