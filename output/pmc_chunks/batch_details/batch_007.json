      "content": "While previously reported primarily in cerebral hemispheres, there have been few reports regarding primary spinal ABs, and no established guidelines have been published on the management of these lesions. Here, the authors present an illustrative case with a systematic review exploring presenting characteristics, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of spinal AB. The patient's electronic medical record was retrospectively reviewed. Additionally, a systematic literature review was performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases for articles published through June 20, 2024, and all English-language articles describing patients with primary spinal AB were analyzed. Conference abstracts and articles describing secondary spinal AB or cerebral AB were excluded. Eleven previous cases of primary spinal AB were identified. Articles were screened by multiple reviewers to limit bias. For each case, clinical presentation, surgical pathology, molecular testing, treatment strategies, clinical course, and outcome were tabulated and compared. A 6-year-old male presented with thoracic back pain and limp and was found to have a high-grade thoracic AB with EWSR1::BEND2 fusion, treated with resection and radiation therapy; he is clinically stable at 12 months of follow-up. A systematic review yielded 11 prior cases; patient ages ranged from 3 months to 36 years, with most cases being pediatric. Clinical presentations commonly featured back pain, motor weakness, and gait disturbances. All cases except one underwent resection. Common pathological findings included perivascular hyalinization, pseudorosettes, pseudopapillae, high cellularity, and positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein/epithelial membrane antigen/S100. Molecular testing showed direct MN1 alteration in 6 cases, while the remaining cases showed MN1 methylation, EWSR1::BEND2 fusion, and MAMLD1::BEND2 fusion. Eight patients underwent chemotherapy, and 7 underwent radiation therapy. Except for 2 reported deaths, most patients were alive at the last follow-up (range 1 month-15 years). Progression of spinal AB occurred in one-third (4/12) of cases. With the present report of a patient whose tumor exhibited EWSR1::BEND2 fusion, there are now 12 total reports in the literature of primary spinal AB. These cases span various pathological and molecular testing results, treatment strategies, and clinical courses. Given the diversity of current molecular signatures of spinal AB, this summative assessment of the current literature offers insights to inform guidelines for classifying AB and developing evidence-based treatment strategies going forward.",

      "content": "Electrically powered orthopedic exercisers, such as continuous passive motion devices, are widely used to enhance joint mobility and muscle recovery. However, existing devices often lack advanced functionalities and user-specific adaptability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these shortcomings, the Rebless Pro was developed as a novel device supporting active and passive exercises with personalized treatment programs. This study aimed to conduct a formative usability evaluation of the Rebless Pro prototype using focus group interviews (FGIs) and satisfaction surveys with health care professionals specializing in rehabilitation medicine. The goal was to identify areas for improvement to enhance the safety, usability, and information clarity of the device. Usability evaluation was performed at the National Rehabilitation Center with 10 participants (5 physiatrists and 5 physical therapists) who had prior experience using similar devices. FGIs were conducted to collect qualitative insights into user experiences, while satisfaction surveys provided quantitative data on ease of use of the user interface and identifiability and understanding of information. Data collection focused on identifying risk factors and usability challenges. Three key areas for improvement were identified: (1) product upgrades to ensure patient safety, including adjustments to exercise speed and resistance; (2) hardware and software improvements to improve usability, including adjustments to the location of the emergency button and improvements to the graphical user interface elements; and (3) improvements to the user manual, including detailed contraindications, patient criteria, and clearer operating instructions. Although the mean score of physiatrists (mean 4.463, SD 0.298) was higher than that of physical therapists (mean 4.114, SD 0.829) in terms of the ease of use of the user interface, the difference was not statistically significant (P=.69). Similarly, in the category of identifiability and understanding of information, higher scores were again reported by physiatrists (mean score 4.467, SD 0.506) than by physical therapists (mean 3.733, SD 0.894), but this difference was also not statistically significant (P=.22). Usability evaluation provided actionable insights into improving the Rebless Pro's safety, usability, and information clarity. To further refine the device, iterative usability evaluations involving both health care professionals and patients are recommended. These efforts are expected to contribute to the development of a safe, effective, and user-friendly electrically powered orthopedic exerciser suitable for commercialization.",

      "content": "The traditional approach is an interposition technique in which Teflon is placed between the nerve and offending vessel. However, recurrent TN pain has been attributed to the Teflon itself, its migration, inflammatory granuloma formation, or continued direct compression. Thus, transposition techniques in which the nerve is fully decompressed without any contact with the offending vessel or the Teflon have been described. In this study, the authors report their institutional experience with interposition and newer transposition techniques such as sling transposition. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who had undergone MVD from July 2015 to March 2024. Demographic, surgical, and clinical variables were collected, including modified Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity scale scores. Clinical outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariate regression, and propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to minimize inherent heterogeneity in the surgical cohorts. Three hundred five patients underwent MVD for TN. Eighty-four patients underwent interposition; 139, transposition with Teflon (full decompression with no contact to the nerve); and 48, transposition using a pericranium sling to the tentorium. A subset of these patients underwent concurrent rhizotomy: 73% interposition cases, 15% Teflon transposition cases, 4% sling transposition cases. Rhizotomy alone was performed in 34 patients. Transposition primarily involved the superior cerebellar artery (90%) and was associated with severe compression and nerve indentation. There were no differences in BNI scores at the last follow-up or in complications among the treatment groups. The only significant predictor of pain freedom on multivariate analysis was MRI demonstrating clear compression (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.147-5.404, p = 0.021). However, subgroup analyses of patients with at least 1 year of follow-up showed a trend for increased pain freedom (BNI scores I and IIIa) with the sling transposition technique at 1 year, which was statistically significant at the 2-year follow-up (1 year: sling 96.6%, Teflon 86.9%, interposition 81.1%, p = 0.053; 2 years: sling 100%, Teflon 87.5%, interposition 77.5%, p = 0.049). PSM cohort analysis showed that sling transposition patients had higher rates of pain-free outcomes (BNI scores I and IIIa) at the last follow-up than the Teflon transposition patients (93.1% vs 62.1%, respectively, p = 0.003). Interposition and transposition techniques for MVD are both effective. The authors' midterm data suggest longer-term TN pain control with sling transposition. Further studies will need to confirm the durability of long-term pain freedom.",

      "content": "Acute postimplantation care varies, with many centers choosing routine postoperative ICU monitoring before transfer to an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). In this study, the authors aimed to describe their institutional experience implementing an ICU bypass guideline for pediatric patients, and to evaluate the safety and benefits of the bypass guideline, while comparing patient characteristics and outcomes before and after guideline implementation. All SEEG surgeries performed from November 2015 to April 2024 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. The center historically admitted all patients to the ICU for the first 24 hours following SEEG. A guideline allowing bypass of initial ICU care for pediatric patients at low risk was instituted in September 2021. A total of 142 children (74 female, mean age 12.6 ± 5.6 years) underwent 149 SEEG surgeries; in all 85 surgeries before guideline implementation, patients were admitted to the ICU, while there were 54 of 64 surgeries (84.3%) in which the patient bypassed the ICU and was admitted to the EMU after guideline implementation. Five patients underwent surgery both before and after the guideline was implemented. Patients excluded from ICU bypass had respiratory (n = 2), behavioral (n = 1), neurological (n = 1), or combined (n = 1) concerns. The before and after guideline implementation groups had similar preoperative medical comorbidities, with patients in 42 procedures overall having neurological (excluding epilepsy, 20.8%, p = 0.16), cardiac (6.7%, p = 0.1), or pulmonary (9.4%, p = 0.27) comorbidities. Patients who underwent SEEG placement before and after guideline implementation did not differ in demographic characteristics (p ≥ 0.05). The overall mean age was 12.6 years, median American Society of Anesthesiologist class was III, mean number of electrodes implanted was 14.4, mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 11 days, and mean duration of leads in place was 8 days. The overall rate of seizure detection was 98%, rate of unplanned head imaging in the first 24 hours after implantation was 5.4%, and rate of ICU transfer in the first 24 hours after implantation was 4%. No patients who underwent SEEG after guideline implementation required subsequent ICU transfer or experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, hardware dislodgment, or unplanned surgery in the first 24 hours after SEEG. After implementation of the ICU bypass guideline, the mean ICU LOS decreased (0.6 vs 1.08 days, p < 0.005), which reduced resource utilization and saved a mean of $2690 per SEEG surgery. After a guideline was implemented to identify patients undergoing SEEG who could bypass the ICU immediately after SEEG implantation, resource utilization was reduced without compromising patient safety or clinical outcomes.",

Therefore, no generalizable surgical outcome metrics for endoscopic endonasal Cushing's disease surgery are available for practitioners to guide quality-improvement efforts. This is potentially problematic, given the high morbidity and excess mortality observed in patients who do not achieve remission. This study proposes a bundle of evidence-based metrics for low-risk patients with Cushing's disease, for whom optimal outcomes would be expected, that focus on the cost efficiency of care and surgical outcomes from multicenter collaboration of US pituitary centers. The steering committee of the Registry of Adenomas of the Pituitary and Related Disorders (RAPID) consortium proposed the metrics based on available data from 12 US pituitary centers. A benchmarking population of low-risk patients undergoing first-time surgery was identified. Patient characteristics and outcomes were aggregated and analyzed by a data coordinating center. Metrics were reported using 2 approaches. A total of 431 patients from 12 centers who underwent primary endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2022, were included.",

Estimated daily intake reached 340.1 ng/kg bw/day (PD) and 201.2 ng/kg bw/day (TDS), exceeding drinking water exposure, with children aged 2-7 facing the highest risk (up to 1009 ng/kg bw/day). Although health indexes (HI <0.18) indicated no immediate hazard, iodinated HAAs associated with other HAAs raised concerns owing to their undefined toxicity. Industrial PD processing (thermal treatment and seasoning) emerged as a key driver of HAA formation, necessitating standardized regulations, increased monitoring, and integration of PDs into food safety frameworks to mitigate risks in China's trillion-yuan PD sector.",

      "content": "The continuous creation of large volumes of assessment items, in a consistent format and comparatively restricted time, is laborious. The application of technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been tried to address this challenge. A major concern raised is the validity of the information produced by AI tools, and if not properly verified, it can produce inaccurate and therefore inappropriate assessments. This study was designed to examine the content validity and consistency of different AI chatbots in creating single best answer (SBA) questions, a refined format of multiple choice questions better suited to assess higher levels of knowledge, for undergraduate medical students. This study followed 3 steps. First, 3 researchers used a unified prompt script to generate 10 SBA questions across 4 chatbot platforms. Second, assessors evaluated the chatbot outputs for consistency by identifying similarities and differences between users and across chatbots. With 3 assessors and 10 learning objectives, the maximum possible score for any individual chatbot was 30. Third, 7 assessors internally moderated the questions using a rating scale developed by the research team to evaluate scientific accuracy and educational quality. In response to the prompts, all chatbots generated 10 questions each, except Bing, which failed to respond to 1 prompt. ChatGPT-4 exhibited the highest variation in question generation but did not fully satisfy the \"cover test.\" Gemini performed well across most evaluation criteria, except for item balance, and relied heavily on the vignette for answers but showed a preference for one answer option. Bing scored low in most evaluation areas but generated appropriately structured lead-in questions. SBA questions from GPT-3.5, Gemini, and ChatGPT-4 had similar Item Content Validity Index and Scale Level Content Validity Index values, while the Krippendorff alpha coefficient was low (0.016). Bing performed poorly in content clarity, overall validity, and item construction accuracy. A 2-way ANOVA without replication revealed statistically significant differences among chatbots and domains (P<.05). However, the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant difference) post hoc test showed no significant pairwise differences between individual chatbots, as all comparisons had P values >.05 and overlapping CIs. AI chatbots can aid the production of questions aligned with learning objectives, and individual chatbots have their own strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, all require expert evaluation to ensure their suitability for use. Using AI to generate SBA prompts us to reconsider Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain, which traditionally positions creation as the highest level of cognition.",

Surveying transcriptomic studies, we identify many key ion transport genes critical for osmoregulation of ions in multiple zooplankton species in response to salinity stress. Laboratory investigations of natural zooplankton populations inhabiting gradients of salinity often reveal additional candidate genes that are not identified in gene expression experiments (e.g., trehalose).",

Specifically, within the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) population, HPV vaccination adherence remains a complex issue. Due to the widespread use of technology within the young adult population, digital health tools such as digital storytelling (DST) have been promoted as an effective way to increase vaccination uptake. The purpose of this study was to conduct a formative inquiry into (1) what components should be considered for inclusion in an HPV documentary tailored for sexual and gender minority populations and (2) what dissemination channels would be more effective and impact the uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine among sexual and gender minority populations. Additionally, this study aims to provide insight into perceived HPV risk and its implications on the HPV vaccine uptake within the LGBTQ+ population. A mixed methods study was conducted between January 2021 and September 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. Intake surveys were distributed to individuals identifying as members of the LGBTQ+ community to examine demographic characteristics, barriers to vaccine adherence, and current HPV vaccination status. Perceived HPV risk was assessed using 5 statements on a 1 to 7 Likert scale. Key informant interviews were conducted via Zoom with participants who completed the intake surveys and consented to be interviewed.",

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of using wearables in real-world clinical settings for children with severe developmental problems to help understand and manage disruptive behavior and to gain insights for the development of forthcoming implementation strategies. A mixed methods design was used to examine two different aspects of the use of wearables in a clinical setting. The first quantitative part of this study focuses on the feasibility of using wearables to collect reliable data on psychophysiological measures during daily activities in children at a children's psychiatric center. The second qualitative part focuses on the evaluation of the implementation process using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify essential steps to successfully incorporate wearable technology in clinical care for children with severe behavioral problems. Empatica E4 wristbands collected data on children's psychophysiological arousal (eg, heart rate [HR] and skin conductance level [SCL]).",

      "content": "Staff reported aggressive behavior and daily activities. Data were processed and visualized in a dashboard. User experiences were assessed through interviews with clinical staff. The implementation process was evaluated using the CFIR. A total of 30 children (27 boys and 3 girls, aged 6 to 14 y; mean age 9.3 y, SD 1.95) wore the wearable for 5 consecutive days. As expected, the children found it easy to wear the device and the clinical staff predominantly expressed positive attitudes toward its use. The data collection proceeded relatively smoothly, and the collected data were of sufficient quality. In total, 315 observations of aggressive behavior were reported, including 54 red incidents (from 18 unique participants) and 261 orange incidents (from 26 unique participants). An exploratory analysis on the association between psychophysiological measures and aggressive behavior revealed that children's HR was significantly higher during aggressive incidents compared to nonaggressive incidents (P=.007). Although not statistically significant, there was a trend suggesting higher peaks per minute during aggressive incidents (P=.07). No significant differences between aggressive and nonaggressive incidents were found for SCL and movement (P=.33 and P=.60). The most challenging CFIR domains in our study were the \"characteristics of the intervention\" and \"the inner setting,\" reflected in the fact that that the majority of implementation activities were focused on these two domains. The use of wearables in a real-world study setting is considered feasible and valuable. However, for broader scaling in daily clinical practice, coherent actions on different domains of implementation are required.",

The control group received the app at the 3-month follow-up. User engagement was analyzed among all participants. Categories of high (100%), moderate (50%-99.9%), and low (<50%) user engagement were created based on the percentage of activities completed in the app. We used paired t tests to compare mean changes in diet quality, dietary intake, and clinical markers within user engagement groups, and fitted linear regression models to analyze differences in change between groups. Data from 119 participants (60.5%, 72/119 men) were analyzed. The mean age at baseline was 63.2 (SD 10.3) years and mean BMI was 30.1 (SD 5.1) kg/m2. User engagement was high with an average of 77.1% of app activities completed. More than half (53.8%, 64/119) of the users showed high user engagement, 21.8% (26/119) moderate, and 24.4% (29/119) low. Directly following the app-based education, a significant difference in change was seen for whole grains (β=20.4, 95%CI 0.57-40.3) in participants with high user engagement compared to the low user engagement group who decreased their intake (P=.03). At follow-up after 6 to 9 months after completed education, significant differences in change were seen for fiber, wholegrains, carbohydrates, saturated fat, sodium, and total energy in the moderate compared with the low engagement group, and a significant difference in change was seen for carbohydrates in the high, compared with the low, user engagement group. User engagement was generally high for the smartphone-based dietary education, suggesting that an app targeting dietary habits is feasible to use. Those with higher user engagement seem to maintain healthier dietary behaviours over time, compared to those with low user engagement. Future mHealth interventions should focus on ways to engage those with low interest.",

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the extent to which the survey data supported the construct validity of the CLIQ framework. A total of 109 health care professionals completed the survey, of which two-thirds (67, 61.5%) were doctors and a quarter (26, 23.9%) were nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Overall, the CLIQ dimensions had good quality scores except for portability, which had a modest score. The inter-item correlations were all positive and not likely due to chance. The Cronbach α coefficient for the overall CLIQ framework was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92). The confirmatory factor analysis provided a modest support for the construct validity of the CLIQ framework with the comparative fit index of 0.86 and standardized root mean square residual of 0.08. The CLIQ framework demonstrated a high reliability and a modest construct validity. The CLIQ framework offers a pragmatic approach to assessing the quality of clinical information in DHTs and could be applied as part of information quality assurance systems in health care settings to improve quality of health information.",

We develop theory demonstrating how habitat distribution shapes trophic interactions, leading to alternative stable states in spatial patterns. Using coral reefs as a model system, we investigate the relationship between halo patterns and predator populations. Specifically, we address the inconsistency between theoretical predictions and empirical observations, where halos are absent in some protected reefs and their sizes are uncorrelated with predator abundance. Our findings reveal that long-term coral distribution patterns influence trophic interactions, supporting the landscape of fear hypothesis. When coral patches are dispersed, herbivore shelter from predators is more evenly distributed across the seascape, facilitating overgrazing and halo oscillation. When coral patches are clustered, limited shelter stabilizes halos, but reduced herbivore limitation can also drive critical transitions to cycles with low vegetation that are difficult to reverse. Discordance between theory and observations may therefore arise from differences in underlying spatial shelter distribution, with broad implications for how landscapes of fear emerge from patchy ecosystems to signal resilience.",

Here, we compare the support for the selection and constraint hypotheses to explain both phenotypic trait covariation and species divergence. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on hindlimb and jumping performance traits within and across species of two frog genera. We compared patterns of within-species phenotypic variation (the <b>P</b> matrix) with divergence and selective covariance matrices, from which we could extract the major axes of the realized adaptive landscape (AL), the directions in which adaptive peaks shifted the most over evolutionary time. We also tested whether the major axes of the AL were related to selection on jumping performance. We found high alignment between patterns of variation across scales. Most divergence occurred in allometric size, defined as the first eigenvector of the <b>P</b> matrix. However, jumping performance gradients were unaligned with the major axes of the AL and the <b>P</b> matrix. Across species, however, evolution of maximum acceleration showed a strong negative relationship with changes in allometric size. We infer that the jumping peak evolved under fluctuating selection, and species have tracked the peak along the direction of most within-species variation, allometric size. We conclude that long-term hindlimb divergence was constrained by developmental interactions among traits associated with growth and not net directional selection. Nonetheless, divergence on size indirectly influenced jumping evolution.",

      "content": "Prenatal anxiety affects between 20% and 30% of pregnant people and is associated with adverse prenatal health conditions, birth outcomes, and postpartum mental health challenges. Individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, and those with low income are all at heightened risk for prenatal anxiety due to disproportionate exposure to adverse social determinants of health. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) has been shown to reliably reduce anxiety in mostly White and middle- to higher-income samples, but its efficacy in low-income and marginalized pregnant people is understudied. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a dCBT (Daylight app, Big Health, Ltd) in a sample of low-income pregnant people oversampled for racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority identity. Participants (N=132) will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control group using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will be a self-guided application that uses an online therapist to teach and encourage the practice of 4 key cognitive behavioral therapy skills (eg, identifying catastrophic thinking and increasing physical relaxation) that can reduce anxiety. The primary outcome will be generalized anxiety symptoms; secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, stress, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. Focus groups with a subset of participants will provide qualitative data about the acceptability of dCBT. Recruitment began in June 2024. Data will be analyzed using linear mixed models, which will be fit with treatment condition (dCBT and waitlist control group) as the between-group factor, time (baseline, 3, 6, and 10 weeks post randomization) as a within-group factor, and a group-by-time interaction. Linear mixed models produce unbiased parameter estimates in situations where there are different numbers of observations per record and will accommodate intent-to-treat and sensitivity analyses. This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of a self-guided dCBT for prenatal anxiety among low-income and marginalized pregnant people, a group that continues to experience substantial barriers to accessing in-person evidence-based psychotherapy.

      "content": "A growing body of research has examined the connection between video game play and relief from anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic years. However, evidence has been limited in dissecting the role of video games in moderating personal health outcomes such as anxiety and depression. This research aimed to provide insights into this area by investigating Chinese college students living under difficult conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place lockdowns. This study investigated the effect of video games on mental disorders among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place lockdown mandates. A mixed methods approach was adopted. The quantitative portion included a cross-sectional survey of a national sample of 2818 (n=1396, 49.54% male vs n=1422, 50.46% female) college students from 8 provinces spanning 16 geographic regions during the extended COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in late 2021 and early 2022. The qualitative portion encompassed 17 semistructured in-depth interviews of (9/17, 53% female vs 8/17, 47% male) students on their experiences, perceptions, and evaluations of playing video games during the lockdowns. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the 7-item self-administered Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, while depression was assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scale. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine whether demographic variables (ie, sex and year in college), modality and content of play, and play time accounted for the outcomes of anxiety and depression. ANOVA tests were performed on overall playtime and the prelockdown-to-lockdown period change in game time on the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Thematic analysis of qualitative data provided additional perspectives on gaming dynamics in relation to anxiety and depression. No significant sex effect was detected in video game play outcomes for anxiety or depression. At the level of the study population, a significant difference between gamers and nongamers was observed to moderate anxiety (t<sub>2816</sub>=-0.42, P=.02) but not depression (t<sub>2816</sub>=-0.12, P=.60) symptoms, controlling for the effect of sex. Playing more online games, spending more time gaming, and an increase in play time were linked to heightened anxiety and depression symptoms. Conversely, playing with friends was connected to lowered anxiety (β=-0.05, P=.04) and depression (β=-0.08, P=.003) scores. The buffer effects of video games may be strongest among routine players with moderate to low anxiety and depression symptoms, while excessive gaming, as shown in the overall amount of game time as well as the prelockdown-to-lockdown period increase in game time, may have detrimental consequences among those struggling with high anxiety and depression. Social play was an effective mechanism in mitigating anxiety and depressive tendencies.",

With the inverse scattering transform (IST) method and its perturbation theory extension, one can go beyond single-soliton physics and investigate nonlinear dynamics of complex optical pulses driven by soliton interactions. Here, advancing the IST perturbation theory approach, we introduce the eigenvalue response functions, which provide an intuitively clear way to manipulate individual characteristics of solitons even in the case of their entire overlapping, i.e., very strong interactions. The response functions reveal the spatial sensitivity of the multisoliton pulse concerning its instantaneous perturbations, allowing one to manipulate the velocities and amplitudes of each soliton. Based on a recirculating optical fiber loop system and homodyne measurement, our experimental setup enables observation of long-distance spatiotemporal NLSE dynamics and complete phase-amplitude characterization of optical pulses containing several solitons, which provides accurate experimental IST spectra. Adding a localized phase perturbation on a box-shaped wave field, we change individual soliton characteristics and can detach solitons selectively from the whole pulse.",

Additionally, the detected phonon signals by the polar Kerr rotation and the ellipticity spectroscopy indicate the circular dichroism (CD) of phonons. We attribute the CD of phonons to their distinct couplings with charge excitations on the tilted Weyl nodal rings in two circularly polarized channels. Our findings provide experimental evidence that, without external fields, phonons can also become circularly polarized by coupling with the electronic topology. Since the magnetic exchange splitting gradually shifts the topological bands in Co_{3}Sn_{2}S_{2}, the CD of phonons exhibits significant temperature dependence, hinting at a promising approach for manipulation.",

In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level.",

In minimal models with only couplings accessible to terrestrial searches, we find that dilaton dark matter with m_{ϕ}≳10^{-10} eV requires couplings suppressed compared to constraints from equivalence principle tests and fifth force searches in order to not produce too much dark matter, improving on the strongest current experimental constraints by up to ∼O(10), with consequences for the proposed mechanical resonator dilaton dark matter searches.

Our findings reveal that the spin response exhibits a strong dependence on both nuclear interactions and many-body wave functions, offering a new avenue for exploring nuclear correlations and dynamics in infinite systems.

In particular, the 1D nonreciprocal edge mode needs to be embedded in a 2D lattice, contradicting with the compactness of integrated photonics. To address these challenges, we investigate the optical nonreciprocity of the 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) superradiance lattices in room-temperature atoms. The probe fields propagating in two opposite directions perceive two different SSH topological phases, which have different absorption spectra due to the interplay between the Zak phase and the thermal motion of atoms, resulting in optical nonreciprocity. Our findings reveal the relationship between 1D topological matter and optical nonreciprocity, simplifying the design of topologically resilient nonreciprocal devices.",

Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory.

Using this system, we measured recombination resulting from site-specific replication fork stalling initiated by Tus binding to an array of Ter sites. We found that a Tus/Ter fork block downstream of direct repeats induced CNV by a mechanism involving the Mph1 translocase, Exo1-catalyzed end resection and Rad51-dependent strand invasion. While the Slx4 scaffold protein and its nuclease-binding partner, Rad1, were shown to be required for duplications, we found that they suppress deletion formation in this context. These opposing functions suggest that both recombination products arise through a large loop heteroduplex intermediate that is cleaved by Rad1-Rad10 in a manner that promotes duplications and eliminates deletions. Taken together, these studies give insight into the mechanisms governing CNV in the context of replication fork stalling, which may ultimately provide a better understanding of how replication stress contributes to cancer and other diseases characterized by genome instability.",

TBX1 regulates chromatin accessibility and gene expression of distinct and evolutionary conserved transcriptional modules for branchiomeric and cardiac development, and for tissue morphogenesis. Computational analyses predicted a feed-forward regulatory relationship between TBX1 and SIX factors. Notably, selected Tbx1 mutant CPM cell populations showed altered differentiation trajectory, exhibiting activation of a mesothelial-like transcriptional program. We also observed cell death later in development. Thus, TBX1 is crucial for maintaining CPM transcriptional identity.",

A cohort of 542 patients with NSCLC with comprehensive SNP data were analyzed. After preprocessing, feature selection was performed using chi-square tests to identify SNPs significantly associated with LNM. Twelve ML models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines, were trained and evaluated using bootstrapped data sets. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and F1 score. Shapley additive explanations values were used for feature interpretability, and survival analysis was conducted to assess clinical outcomes. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models achieved the highest predictive performance, with median AUCs of 0.93 and 0.91, respectively. Key SNPs, including mutations in <i>TANC2</i>, <i>KCNT2</i>, and <i>CENPF</i>, were consistently identified as predictive features.",

These rare but severe complications, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), appear multifactorial, influenced by prior cytotoxic therapies, radiation exposure, clonal hematopoiesis, and germline predispositions. This review synthesizes data on PRRT-related hematologic toxicities, including findings from pivotal studies and real-world evidence. We explore risk factors, underlying mechanisms, and the potential role of biomarkers such as clonal hematopoiesis and germline mutations in predicting toxicity. Emerging approaches, including alpha particle radioligand therapy and advanced dosimetry are explored as strategies to optimize patient selection and minimize adverse outcomes. To maximize the benefits of PRRT while safeguarding patient safety, future efforts should focus on integrating predictive biomarkers, refining treatment sequencing, and developing personalized, risk-stratified approaches to therapy.",

We conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine the roles of IDO and KP metabolites in intracellular parasitic infections. Our analysis focused on studies involving <i>Leishmania, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii</i>, and <i>Plasmodium</i> species. IDO has a dual role in parasitic diseases: L-Trp depletion can inhibit parasite growth, but also promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment that may facilitate pathogen persistence. This balance between host defense and immune evasion is crucial in chronic infections. We discuss how IDO activity intersects with parasite immune evasion strategies and review potential therapeutic approaches targeting the IDO-KP axis. IDO plays a complex and context-dependent role in the immunopathology of intracellular parasitic infections. While it may support host defense, its immunoregulatory effects can also favor chronic infection. Therapeutically targeting the IDO pathway is a promising strategy, but requires further investigation to optimize its clinical application.",

The 25 food groups of the GDQS were used to assign points for categories of consumption according to gram-weight cutoffs adapted for children based on energy requirements. As a preliminary step, alternative versions of gram-weight cutoffs were tested by comparing correlation analyses using 4 existing dietary datasets from low-, middle-, and high-income countries. A final GDQS metric version, selected based on strength of correlations and operational feasibility, was further examined in regression analyses with individual nutrient intake an overall nutrient intake adequacy score and biomarker and anthropometry outcomes in 7 dietary datasets from different countries. Regressions were also undertaken with other diet quality metrics to compare their relative performance with that of the GDQS. The GDQS had strong associations with most nutrient intakes, including an overall mean nutrient adequacy score and some nutrients associated with noncommunicable disease risk, such as fiber and added sugar. Biomarker data were limited in the available datasets and few associations with GDQS were found. The GDQS performed better or as well as other dietary quality metrics in predicting nutrient intakes. The GDQS was associated with nutrient intakes and fills a gap in a global diet quality metric for children. The GDQS will be a useful tool to measure diet quality and monitoring changes in diet quality over time.",

One potential path to such change is through institutional feeding programs, such as schools feeding. Despite the wide reach of institutional feeding programs there has not until recently been a simple yet rigorous metric that can measure, track, and evaluate the nutritional quality of the meals and menus. This lack of standardized measurement is particularly noticeable in low- and middle-income countries, with the implication that the relative contribution of institutional feeding programs towards reducing malnutrition or how to invest to maximize impact remains largely unknown. The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS)-Meal and GDQS-Menu metrics were designed to fill this gap and to enable consistent and accurate tracking of the nutritional quality of meals and menus around the world. Derived from the existing Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) metric, the GDQS-Meal and GDQS-Menu metrics assign a point total for the overall nutritional quality of a meal or menu based on its performance of four sub-metrics: 1) Healthy GDQS-Meal (or Menu), 2) Unhealthy GDQS-Meal (or Menu), 3) Fortification and Biofortification, and 4) Food Group Diversity. The metrics were designed to be low-burden and easy-to-use while maintaining scientific rigor for individuals of all ages in schools and across other institutional feeding programs such as prisons and workplace cafeterias.",

The resulting lanthanum-nitrogen-carbon dots were carefully analyzed for their consistent structure, optical properties, and size, all of which indicated successful activation. The research then explored the antimicrobial potential of both La-NCDs and FDG against common pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. La-NCDs inhibit microbes greatly, demonstrating inhibition zones of up to 41 mm and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 500-2000 µg/mL depending on the microbe. In contrast, FDG displays weak antimicrobial activity. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl/2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay was used to estimate the antioxidant properties of the materials. La-NCDs were more efficient as antioxidants than FDG and inhibited free radicals with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 121.88 µg/mL.",

We employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the methanolic extract of T. govanianum for antimicrobial activities against standard reference strains of bacteria and fungi. We estimated antioxidant activity using three different radical scavenging assays: 2,2-dihpenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays. Our results show that the proportion of pharmaceutically important steroids significantly declined, while unsaturated fatty acids increased with increasing elevation. The antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract of T. govanianum showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease with an increase in elevation. Likewise, the antimicrobial activity of T. govanianum observed against bacterial and fungal strains also decreased significantly with elevation. Taken together, our findings can help in a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between chemodiversity and biological properties of this pharmaceutically prized Himalayan herb under the varying environmental conditions along elevation, with useful insights into the chemical ecology of medicinal plants in mountains.",

This paper presents an analysis of meningitis and/or encephalitis in 2023, caused by <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and tick-borne encephalitis virus. The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiological situation of meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2023 taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To evaluate the epidemiological situation of neuroinfections in Poland, data sent to NIPH NIH-NRI by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and published in the annual bulletin: \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2023\" and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2023\" as well as individual epidemiological reports registered in the EpiBaza system. In 2023, there were 2754 cases of meningitis and/or encephalitis, an increase of 57.6% compared to 2022 (1748 cases) and 22.5% against 2019 (2249 cases). Incidences of bacterial etiology, including neuroborreliosis, increased by 39.7% (from 848 in 2022 to 1185 in 2023, incidence: 2.24 to 3.14 per 100,000). The incidence for <i>N. meningitidis</i> increased by 17.6(from 0.17 to 0.20), for <i>H. influenzae</i> by 125% (from 0.04 to 0.09), and for <i>S. pneumoniae</i> by 30.9% (from 0.55 to 0.72). Viral infections accounted for 57% of the total, and their number increased by 74.3% (from 900 in 2022 to 1,569 in 2023). The highest number of viral infections was for tick-borne encephalitis, with 661 cases (up 48.2%). 2023 showed an overall upward trend in the number of registered cases of meningitis and/or encephalitis of bacterial and viral etiology compared to 2022.",

Despite the recognized impact of tobacco on oral health, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the specific characteristics of the subgingival microbiome among Indian tobacco users. This study seeks to provide a comparative analysis of subgingival microbial profile of smokeless tobacco users and smokers with an otherwise healthy periodontal environment. This cross-sectional study at a Tertiary Dental Hospital in India recruited 118 participants: 52 non-tobacco users (Group 1), 36 smokeless tobacco users (Group 2), and 30 smokers (Group 3). Subgingival samples were collected from mesial surfaces of teeth (16, 46) using sterile paper points and analysed via the streak plate method for bacterial profiling. Clinical examinations assessed oral hygiene, gingival, and periodontal health using indices: Bleeding on Probing (BoP), Pocket Depth (PD), and Approximate Plaque Index (API).",

Neurosyphilis (NS) can be asymptomatic or manifest as meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, parenchymatous syphilis, CNS gummas, ocular or auricular syphilis. To evaluate patients with LS and NS hospitalized at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology and treated at Outpatient Clinic of Medical University of Bialystok in years 2014-2023. A retrospective analysis of socio-demographic, epidemiological and clinical data, treatment of patients with LS and NS and, in part, their serological response after treatment. Over a ten-year period 25 patients were treated for LS: 14 men and 11 women. The mean age in men was 39.3 and in women - 38.4 years (P>0.05). Majority of patients lived in urban areas and was in a steady partnership. Five men (35.7%) declared homosexual intercourses. Symptomatic LS was diagnosed only in one men. The median titre of a VDRL test was 1/16. After treatment follow up was completed in nine (36.0%) patients. In four of them (44.4%) no decline in VDRL titre was noticed one year after treatment. In the same period eight patients were treated for NS, confirmed by a cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) examination. Only one of them had asymptomatic NS, remaining ones had neurological or ophthalmic abnormalities. In seven (87.5%) the VDRL test titre was at least 1/64. Half of men with NS were co-infected with HIV prior to diagnosis of NS. The study results confirm that LS is asymptomatic in majority of cases. Adherence to after-treatment follow-up remains suboptimal. The results suggest that in patients with high titre of serological tests for syphilis and concomitant HIV infection examination of CSF might be needed.",

      "content": "Although the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends using clinicians' prediction of survival (CPS) as an initial reference, CPS alone often lacks precision. This review synthesizes current prognostic models and the dialog surrounding EOL survival prediction. For patients with an expected survival of months, several validated prognostic tools are available, including measures such as the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, the modified Glasgow Prognostic Scale, and comprehensive models such as the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicator Tool and the adaptable prognosis prediction model. When survival is expected to be weeks, the Palliative Performance Scale serves as a key assessment tool, while models such as the Palliative Prognostic Index and Prognosis in Palliative Care Study models are helpful. In the final days of life, clinicians primarily rely on observable physical indicators, including decreased consciousness and specific breathing patterns, whereas the surprise question has demonstrated limited predictive utility in this context. While most patients with advanced cancer express a desire for prognostic information, cultural considerations-particularly in Asia-necessitate nuanced communication approaches. Serious illness conversations have been shown to improve patient well-being; however, further research is needed to optimize these discussions, address unfinished business, and promote equitable access to prognostic dialog, particularly for vulnerable populations. Enhancing prognostic communication is critical for facilitating shared decision-making and improving the quality of EOL care.",

The findings reveal that the family, often idealised as a 'desexualised' safe space, perpetuates patriarchal norms, while the public sphere commodifies sexuality and exacerbates gendered risks. These domains, rather than existing in isolation, are deeply interconnected, with porous boundaries between them that sustain structural inequalities. Women's narratives transform individual memories into collective memory acts, leveraging social media as a critical battlefield for advocacy and compensatory education. Yet, fragmented and emotionally charged digital dialogues often face structural barriers, limiting their capacity to drive systemic change. The study underscores the transformative potential of digital memory activism in challenging socio-cultural norms and emphasises the critical need for institutional efforts to establish inclusive and comprehensive sex education as a cornerstone of gender equity.",

Results were tracked using Strongyloides reports generated by the electronic health-record system. This paper describes the changes in prevalence, effectiveness of treatment, and reinfection during the implementation phase, 2012-2016. An improved Strongyloides electronic report was developed to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention to the end of 2020. During the entire period 2012-2020, 84% (2390/2843) of the resident adults in the four communities were tested for strongyloidiasis at least once. Prevalence was reduced from 44% (1056/2390) ever-positive to 10% (232/2390) positive on their last test. Of positive, treated cases with a follow-up serology test, the last test was negative in 85% (824/967) of individuals. Point prevalence continued to decrease in each community four years after the end of the implementation phase. The results provided practice-based evidence of a significant decrease in the prevalence of strongyloidiasis attributable to the strategy which could be replicated in other health services utilising electronic health-record systems. The final evaluation demonstrated the sustainability and ongoing benefits for endemically infected communities, and the key role that health services can play in strongyloidiasis prevention and control programs.",

      "content": "Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) augmentation at the time of hip arthroscopy is a potential solution to improve functional outcomes in patients with cartilage damage concomitant with acetabular labral tearing; however, follow-up functional scores to date have not exceeded 24 months. Therefore, the present study compares minimum 5-year outcomes in patients treated with or without BMAC augmentation to address chondral damage during arthroscopic labral repair. This was a prospective cohort study analyzing patients who underwent acetabular labral repair performed by a single surgeon. Patients were stratified into either the BMAC cohort or the control cohort depending on whether BMAC was utilized in conjunction with arthroscopic labral repair. Demographic and intraoperative variables, including chondrolabral junction breakdown and articular cartilage damage, were compared between cohorts, as were patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at enrollment and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. Eighty-one hips were included for analysis: 39 (38 patients) in the BMAC cohort and 42 (39 patients) in the control cohort. Univariate analyses demonstrated similar baseline characteristics between groups, including body mass index, Tönnis angle, lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), and alpha angle (p > 0.05 for each). Patients treated with BMAC and patients in the control group reported similar PROMs between enrollment and the 12-month follow-up. By the 24-month follow-up, patients treated with BMAC reported significantly higher scores for the modified Harris hip score (mHHS) (p = 0.004), the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 (iHOT-33) (p = 0.012), and the Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL) (p = 0.008). This trend persisted over time, with the BMAC cohort demonstrating significantly higher scores for the mHHS (p < 0.001), iHOT-33 (p = 0.006), and the Hip Outcome Score-Sports Subscale (HOS-SS) (p = 0.012) at 60 months. Patients undergoing acetabular labral repair with BMAC augmentation reported significantly greater functional improvements compared with patients undergoing repair without BMAC. These differences generally did not become significant until 24 months after surgery, at which point they increased in magnitude until the 60-month follow-up. These findings, the first intermediate-term outcomes reported following hip arthroscopy with BMAC, therefore suggest favorable benefit at an extended follow-up. Therapeutic Level III.",

Participants were classified into high-risk (southern Taiwan) and low-risk (other regions) groups. Message fatigue was assessed using the message environment (ME) and audience response (AR) dimensions. Perceived risks (perceived prevalence, severity, and optimistic bias) and demographic variables (sex, age, education, job experience, and residency) were analyzed using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models. revealed that message fatigue varied by region and demographic factors. In high-risk areas, individuals with lower education levels exhibited higher AR fatigue (boredom and disengagement) (p = 0.04). In low-risk areas, males (p = 0.02), individuals with lower education (p = 0.01), and those with optimistic bias (p = 0.02) reported significantly higher ME fatigue (perceived overexposure). Despite uniform nationwide messaging, participants in high-risk regions exhibited greater message fatigue, possibly due to habituation. Message fatigue is associated with regional dengue risk, demographic factors, and perceived risk. A uniform health communication approach may not be effective across different populations. In high-risk regions, message fatigue is more pronounced. Repetitive warnings may contribute to disengagement, suggesting a need for communication strategies that reduce redundancy and emphasize localized, actionable information. In low-risk areas, messages should focus on engagement, particularly for men, who exhibited higher fatigue in this study. Simplified messaging can reduce cognitive overload for lower-educated populations. Addressing message fatigue can enhance the effectiveness of dengue prevention campaigns and sustain public engagement in long-term health communication efforts.",

We established the first reverse genetics system for BATV, generated reassortants, and employed minigenome assays to assess replication machinery compatibility. Additionally, we developed a novel hybridization chain reaction assay for high-resolution visualization of viral RNA segments. Our findings revealed that all six reassortants between BUNV and BATV are viable, exhibiting notable phenotypic differences in interferon-deficient (IFNAR-/-) mice. This work introduces essential tools and new insights into orthobunyavirus reassortment and pathogenesis, laying the groundwork for understanding this critical evolutionary process.",

However, the segregation is considerably more pronounced in ITIC-based systems, where the enriched interface consists of pure ITIC, compared to a maximum of 67% PC<sub>71</sub>BM by volume in the former system. Prolonging film drying with higher solvent additive content exacerbates segregation in both systems, increasing interfacial acceptor concentration in PC<sub>71</sub>BM systems and broadening the buried interface in ITIC systems. Simulations confirm that extreme vertical segregation in ITIC-based devices induces nonideal 's-shaped' <i>JV</i> curves when the enriched layer is pure and sufficiently thick, as seen in both fresh and aged devices. Our findings highlight that improper vertical segregation not only leads to poor device performance in fresh devices, but gradual segregation can also contribute to morphological degradation and device instabilities over time.",

      "content": "Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) is a clinically significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen, particularly implicated in pulmonary infections among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Tedizolid (TZD), an oxazolidinone-class antibacterial drug, has been recommended as an alternative treatment for MAB-infected patients who are intolerant to or whose isolate is resistant to first-line drugs including linezolid (LZD). To investigate the TZD resistance mechanisms in MAB, we isolated 23 TZD-resistant MAB mutants and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify resistance-associated genes. Frequent mutations were identified in MAB_2885, encoding a putative TetR transcriptional regulator, and MAB_2303, encoding a putative mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL). Drug susceptibility testing confirmed that MAB_2885 mutations contribute to both TZD and LZD resistance in MAB. RNA-seq analysis revealed that restoring wild-type MAB_2885 in mutants downregulated the MAB_2302-MAB_2303. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed the MAB_2885 protein binds to its target sequence upstream of MAB_2302-MAB_2303, further confirming their regulatory relationship. The W91R mutation in the MAB_2885 protein was found to impair its DNA-binding activity compared to the wild-type. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis confirmed that MAB_2302-MAB_2303 functions as a TZD efflux pump.",

In this study, we report an unconventional mechanism by which MCPyV enters the host cell nucleus, where viral genome replication occurs. We demonstrate that, unlike other known polyomaviruses, MCPyV does not require the nuclear pore complex during entry. Instead, it takes advantage of cell cycle-dependent nuclear envelope breakdown to deliver its genetic material into the nucleus. We further show that the VP1 major capsid protein is sufficient to facilitate this process. Overall, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of polyomavirus nuclear entry and provide insight into the diverse mechanisms that these viruses use to cause infection.",

Altogether, 163 759 and 219 785 unmet MPQ criteria were identified, respectively, at the health systems. The rank order and the probability distribution of the unmet MPQ criteria were not statistically significantly different between health systems (P = .844 and P = .92, respectively). The 3 most-common unmet MPQ criteria were: short PNL length on the craniocaudal (CC) view, inadequate pectoralis muscle, and excessive exaggeration on the CC view. The percentages of unmet positioning criteria out of the total potential unmet positioning criteria at health system 1 and health system 2 were 8.4% (163 759/1 949 922) and 7.3% (219 785/3 030 129), respectively. Artificial intelligence identified a similar distribution of unmet MPQ criteria in 2 health systems' daily work. Knowledge of current commonly unmet MPQ criteria can facilitate the improvement of mammography quality through tailored education strategies.",

Interviews were analysed using constructivist grounded theory. A theory of recovery was developed by data grounded in the narratives of people with lived experience. Five major categories were constructed and linked to the process of recovery. These are presented as the 5rs of recovery: (1) readiness to change, (2) roadblocks, (3) recovery factors, (4) risk factors and (5) relapse. Underpinning each category is a combination of biological, psychological, social and systemic factors. Our findings propose a theory on the process of recovery and present common recovery factors. The presented model of recovery could be used as a formulation tool to help individuals living with T1DE and their healthcare teams, both in mental health and diabetes settings. Those working with this population may want to consider how their services can facilitate any of the listed recovery factors as well as limit the barriers mentioned.",

This study aims to describe the clinical situations encountered by SC2 and the procedures they perform in operational environments. A retrospective study of professional practices based on an online questionnaire was conducted to identify the types of injuries managed by SC2 and the frequency of procedures performed. The exposure levels of SC2 and their proficiency in performing life-saving interventions were assessed. This research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the French Research Bureau of the Directorate for Training, Research, and Innovation. Data from 374 questionnaires were analyzed in this study. Hemorrhage was the most frequent condition encountered, representing 56.3% of cases (n=209). Tourniquet application was performed by 48.5% of SC2 at least once, with a 92% success rate. Airway obstruction was managed in 15.8% of cases (n=58), with advanced airway procedures such as cricothyroidotomy being performed in 4.1% of cases (n=15). SC2 managed shock in 43.2% of cases (n=153) and severe traumatic brain injury in 46.4% (n=163). Vascular access was the most performed technical procedure, with 87.5% of personnel exposed (n=309). SC2 had to frequently manage these situations without nurse or physician support, in up to 42.6% of hemorrhagic cases. Although hemorrhage control remains the primary challenge, SC2 must be prepared to handle a broad spectrum of battlefield injuries, including complex airway and circulatory management. In high-intensity conflicts, they may need to provide prolonged field care (PFC) without immediate SC3 support. These findings highlight the need to adapt training programs and doctrinal guidelines to better equip SC2 for independent casualty management in austere environments.",

Irregular chlorotic spots appeared on the surface of the leaves, then larger necrotic spots showed grayish-white centers and brown margins formed. Numerous pycnidia appeared at later stages of development. To isolate the pathogen, 20 symptomatic leaves were collected from ten trees and cut into small pieces (0.4 cm<sup>2</sup>) at the junction between diseased and healthy tissue. All pieces were surface disinfected with 75% ethanol for 30 s then rinsed three times with sterilized distilled water, dried with sterilized filter paper, placed on potato dextrose (PDA), and incubated in darkness at 27 ° C. Seventeen isolates were obtained using the hyphal-tip method, all of which exhibited similar morphological characteristics. Colonies initially appeared white, and after 5-7 days, they gradually turned gray-green to dark gray with dense aerial mycelia. Conidia forming on pycnidia were one-celled, hyaline, fusiform, subtruncate at the base, subobtuse at the apex, and measured 19.4 -25.9 μm (23.1 ± 1.6 μm) × 5.2 - 9.2 μm (7.1 ± 0.9 μm) (n = 30), consistent with the description of <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> (Zhang et al.",

Results from the maximum likelihood analyses, based on the three concatenated gene sequences using PhyloSuite version 1.2.2 (Zhang et al., 2020), placed the isolates in a clade with <i>B. dothidea</i>. To assess pathogenicity, ten healthy leaves from each of five 1-year-old <i>E. japonicus</i> plants grown in a greenhouse were wounded with a sterilized needle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from actively growing colonies of isolate DQWM01 on PDA were applied to 5 leaves of <i>E. japonicus</i>, while the other 5 wounded leaves on the same plant were treated with agar plugs. All plants were incubated at 25°C, 70% humidity, and 14 h/10 h photoperiod. Seven days after inoculation, brown lesions appeared, which turned grayish-white with brown margins, similar to field symptoms, but the control leaves remained symptomless. <i>B. dothidea</i> culture was reisolated from all the infected leaves and identified using morphological characteristics and DNA sequence analysis, completing Koch's postulates. The pathogenicity test was performed three times with similar results. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>B. dothidea</i> in China causing leaf spot on <i>E. japonicus</i>. The disease significantly threatens <i>E. japonicus</i>'s ornamental value, requiring urgent and targeted control measures.",

This section will summarize the preclinical and clinical studies for inhaled Pulmozyme® (recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, rhDNase), insulin, human growth hormone (hGH), cyclosporine, alpha-1 antitrypsin, measles vaccine, and anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE). For Pulmozyme® (rhDNase), monkeys had positive serum antibody titers to rhDNase and allergic/hypersensitivity (type I) lung lesions in response to foreign protein likely due to differences in homology between monkey and human DNases. However, in patients, the levels of rhDNase antibodies were low and of no consequence. For inhaled insulin in rats, dogs and monkeys, there were no adverse effects related to insulin or excipients. In clinical trials, over 13,000 patients were safely treated with inhaled insulin for an average of 1 year. Some patients had higher antibody levels than comparators, but these antibodies did not decrease the effectiveness, safety or tolerability of inhaled insulin over time and/or affect clinical outcomes. Inhaled hGH had no adverse effects in monkeys, healthy volunteers or pediatric patients, but its absorption from the lungs was too low (<5%) in pediatric patients to be successful as a medical product. Inhaled cyclosporine had no unexpected systemic toxicity or clinically limiting findings in the respiratory tract in rat and dogs; it also had promising Phase 2 clinical data but failed in Phase 3. Inhaled alpha-1 antitrypsin also failed in a recent Phase 2/3 trial. A liquid inhaled measles vaccine was safe, well tolerated and produced an appropriate immune response in Phase 2/3 studies for children ages 10-35 months, but not younger. A dry powder inhaled vaccine in monkeys had no adverse effects and produced an immune response; Phase 1 trials are underway.",

Compared with the control group, extreme heat exposure induced temperature dysregulation, impaired liver function and morphological damage in mice. Proteomics screened PPARα as protein of interest, with its level being significantly decreased in response to extreme heat exposure. Both PPARα activation and overexpression attenuated extreme heat-induced heatstroke and liver injury. Hmox1 was next screened and higher Hmox1 expression was identified, accompanied with elevated markers of ferroptosis including prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels. Ferroptosis inhibition mitigated heatstroke and liver injury induced by heat exposure. In the setting of extreme heat exposure, PPARα activation suppressed Hmox1 expression and levels of ferroptosis markers. It not only induced differences in the expression of members of iron generation, efflux and uptake process and reduced hepatic intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, but also stimulated expression of molecules for countering lipid peroxidation including Nrf2-SLC7A11-GPX4 axis and FSP1 signaling. PPARα played an essential role in extreme heat exposure-induced heatstroke and liver injury, and PPARα intervention conferred protection against it via inhibition of ferroptosis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15326.",

      "content": "Myoelectric prostheses offer great promise in enabling amputees to perform daily activities independently. However, existing neural interfaces generally cannot simultaneously and proportionally decode kinematics and kinetics in real time, nor can they directly interpret neural commands. We thus propose a novel framework that integrates motor unit activity with deep learning and demonstrate its efficiency in the real-time, simultaneous, and proportional estimation of wrist angles and grasp forces. This framework utilizes real-time high-density surface electromyography decomposition to identify motor neuron discharges, followed by neural drive computation integrated with a modular Long Short-Term Memory-based neural network.",

The proposed framework significantly outperformed five baseline methods, achieving an nRMSE of 13.6% and 11.1% and an R<sup>2</sup> of 73.2% and 76.8% for wrist angle and grasp force, respectively. In addition, we further characterized the spatial distribution and recruitment patterns of motor units during movement generation. These findings highlight the feasibility of integrating neural drive insights with deep learning methods to improve simultaneous and proportional estimation performance.

      "content": "We aim to mitigate the effects of secondary fields generated by induced eddy currents in the context of gradient array coils while simultaneously managing the time-averaged ohmic power losses within the cryostat. The proposed electromagnetic approach streamlines the tuning process and provides customized solutions for array coils of diverse configurations. It can be considered a dynamic and array-specific extension of the pre-emphasis technique employed in conventional gradient coils. We sample and record the net (impressed and secondary) electromagnetic fields within the imaging region and on the cryostat's surface just once. Utilizing the electromagnetic Poynting theorem and the extracted data, we optimize for a complex constellation of array currents across discrete frequencies, adhering to a set of explicit constraints. These constraints fulfill the performance parameters within the imaging volume while minimizing ohmic power losses within the cryostat assembly and across the copper wires. For numerical demonstrations, we deploy a 48-element whole-body z-gradient array coil embedded within a stainless-steel cryostat assembly and compute 48 gradient waveforms that compensate for intense eddy currents generated by a trapezoidal pulse of 300 T/m/s slew rate. Our computational approach enables precise control over eddy and copper losses, simplifies array coil tuning on-the-fly, and can be adapted to various gradient coils.",

HFs are characterized by their high water content and have a fibrous shape with a cross-linking network in condensed structures. They combine the functional characteristics of hydrogel materials (soft, wet, environmentally, responsive, biocompatible) with the structural advantages of fiber materials (high aspect ratio, anisotropy, flexibility). Therefore, a systematic understanding of the development and current challenges of HFs is of great significance for their functionalization and structural construction, potentially leading to the realization of bionic functions similar to those found in the human body. This paper discussing the development of HFs, focusing on material composition, structural design, functional construction, and applications, while also addressing the limitations and challenges associated with HFs in detail. The goal of this review is to provide guidelines for the construction of functional or bionic HFs and their practical applications.",

It can be divided into six biotypes and approximately 60 O-serotypes, with O:3, O:9, O:8 and O:5,27 being predominantly associated with human yersiniosis. We present a two-group quadruplex real-time quantitative PCR (RT‒qPCR) for the patho-serotyping of Y. enterocolitica. The design of primers and probes within group 1 was based on sero-specific genes within the O antigen gene cluster, and those within group 2 were selected from the virulence markers and the restriction modification system to distinguish O:5,27 from O:5. The specificity was tested using reference strains, and was confirmed by a comparison with those obtained by a previous multiplex PCR. The limit of detection is 0.1 ng, or 104 copies μl-1 of genomic DNA, and the standard curves exhibited high linearity and correlation coefficients, demonstrating our assay's robustness. Among the 81 isolates used to evaluate the reproducibility, the results for 76 were consistent between the two approaches, indicating that the sensitivity of our RT‒qPCR is 100%, and the positive predictive value is 94%.",

The primary endpoint was to determine the total number of oocytes retrieved. Key secondary endpoints included total hMG dose, days of hMG stimulation, fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate and safety. A total of 150 patients were randomised into two groups: 77 received Gynogen HP and 73 received Menopur COS. The primary end point, number of oocytes retrieved (mean±SD), was similar between the Gynogen HP (6.3±3.39) and Menopur (6.7±4.52) groups. Least square (LS) mean values were 5.9 for the Gynogen HP and 6.3 for Menopur, with an LS mean difference of - 0.4 (95% CI: -1.83, 1.07; p=0.6067); indicating non-inferiority as the lower limit of the 95% CI was above the non-inferiority threshold of -2.0. Secondary efficacy endpoints and safety analysis showed no significant differences between groups. Gynogen HP is non-inferior and therapeutically equivalent to Menopur in terms of the number of oocytes retrieval, with a comparable safety profile. These results support the use of Gynogen HP for COS in women undergoing IVF as a part of assisted reproduction techniques.",

Illicit cannabis (56.7%) was the most common access pathway. 99% of respondents stated they will continue to utilise cannabis to manage their endometriosis-based symptoms, with 90% reporting they would recommend its use to a friend or relative with the disease. The most common motivation(s) for cannabis consumption were inadequate pain control (68.6%) and bothersome side-effects of medications (56.3%). Similar motivations were reported for ongoing cannabis consumption, with concerns over dependence / addiction on pharmaceutical medications (43.9%) being another common motivation. Those using illicit cannabis were significantly less likely (p<0.0001) to disclose their cannabis consumption to medical professionals. Cannabis was viewed as superior to pharmaceuticals both in terms of effectiveness and side-effect profile. Despite this, concerns around cost, breaking the law, judgement due to stigma, and current drug driving laws were reported. Illicit usage and lack of medical oversight raises concerns over potential drug interactions or withdrawal effects due to reduction in pharmaceutical medications due to cannabis.",

Rice plants expressing <i>Xa21</i> but lacking a functional <i>OsRBL3b</i> displayed impaired anther dehiscence and pollen viability, resulting in male sterility and yield reduction with high levels of XA21 protein present in spikelets during anthesis. In leaves, <i>osrbl3b</i> mutants expressing XA21 had normal levels of this resistance protein and disease immunity. This balance between reproduction and disease resistance through the specific expression of a rhomboid protease may be key to limiting the detrimental effects of an active immune response and may be useful in future for genetic improvement of crops.",

However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are [Formula: see text]-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.",

      "content": "Due to a worldwide rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), phages have been proposed as a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections. Up to this point in history, phage use in preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and emergency-use compassionate care cases has centered around the original observation from 1915 showing phage as lytic agent, and thus a treatment that kills bacteria. Here, we describe an activity associated with phage therapy that extends beyond lytic activity that results in long-term protection against reinfection. This activity is potent, providing almost complete protection against a second lethal infection for animals treated with phage therapy. The activity also reduced infection burden an astounding billion-fold over the control. Reinfection protection requires phage lytic killing of its target bacterium but is independent of additional phage therapy. The effect is not driven by phage alone, lingering phage resistors, or a sublethal inoculum. In vitro phage-lysed bacteria provide partial protection, suggesting a combination of phage-induced lytic activity and immune stimulation by phage treatment is responsible for the effect. These observations imply certain phages may induce host adaptive responses following the lysis of the infecting bacteria. This work suggests phage therapy may contain a dual-action effect, an initial treatment efficacy followed by a long-term protection against reoccurring infection, a therapeutic-vaccination mechanism of action.",

Diminished TSH (thyrotropin) signalling may also impair learning and memory by inhibiting the Wnt5a-β-catenin pathway. Thyroid disorders may also contribute to neurodegeneration by T3-mediated attenuation of amyloid-β elimination or TRH-induced formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Surprisingly, most clinical studies do not specify the immune origin of hypo-/hyperthyroidism, therefore, further studies involving large, well-characterized patient cohorts are needed to clarify the relationships between AITD and cognitive impairments and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, data on the effect of anti-thyroid antibodies on brain function are scarce and inconclusive. Given the association between hyperthyroidism and an increased risk of dementia, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders, adequate treatment and careful monitoring of AITD patients are essential to prevent the induction of exogenous hyperthyroidism.",

Poorly attached cells often exhibit rounded morphology and form dynamic protrusions called blebs. While the role of blebs in amoeboid migration is well-documented, recent studies have highlighted their role in anoikis resistance. However, little is known about whether the most abundant membrane components-phospholipids- function in blebs-facilitated anoikis resistance. Here, we report an enrichment of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and a depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at bleb membrane, compared to non-bleb regions of the plasma membrane. Our results have shown that both PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> have restricted diffusion pattern between the bleb and non-bleb membrane regions. Subsequently, we reveal that PI3K is recruited by SH3KBP1 via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and interacted with Septin at the bleb necks. This Septin-SH3KBP1-PI3K axis then contributes to differential phosphoinositides (PIs) distribution and anoikis resistance. These novel insights into PIs dynamics and the associated molecular scaffolding not only elucidate the mechanisms of blebs formation and anoikis resistance, but also highlight potential targets for therapeutic interventions in anchorage-independent cancers.",

Quantitative analysis of the π-orbital exciton recombination kinetics by a rate equation resolves three distinct photocarrier relaxation pathways: monomolecular trapping, bimolecular recombination, and defect-assisted Auger recombination. The photocarrier kinetics accelerates nonlinearly as the excitation densities increase, revealing the dominance of the Auger recombination under intense photoexcitation. Notably, the extracted Auger recombination coefficient on thermally treated CN (TTCN) is significantly reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that of pristine CN (PCN), mainly attributing to the deactivation of the defect states by crystallinity enhancement. These findings establish a comprehensive kinetic framework for defect-mediated Auger recombination in graphitic CN, offering critical guidance to advance its applications for photoelectric conversion.",

      "content": "This spherical resonator, which functions both as an acoustic resonator and a gas chamber, facilitates efficient sound wave coupling between the resonator and the quartz tuning fork (QTF), enabling double resonance. The frequency response and acoustic field distribution of the radial spherical resonator were calculated using the finite element method. The radius of the spherical resonator was optimized to 27.34 mm to realize perfect resonance coupling with the QTF. A novel T-tip QTF with a low resonance frequency of 8.97 kHz was positioned at the center of the spherical resonator to detect the photoacoustic signal though its piezoelectric effect and resonance characteristics. Acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) were selected as target gases to evaluate the performance of the QEPAS sensor. Experimental results showed that incorporating the spherical resonator enhanced the 2<i>f</i> signal amplitudes by factors of 13.03 and 13.29 for the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-QEPAS and CH<sub>4</sub>-QEPAS systems, respectively. The long-term stability and optimal detection performance of the designed sensor were evaluated using Allan deviation analysis. The designed QEPAS sensor achieved minimum detection limits (MDLs) of 337.2 ppb for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and 422 ppb for CH<sub>4</sub> at average times of 900 s and 1000 s, respectively.",

      "content": "Unlike the commonly used catalyst of water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), whose concentration in the air frequently changes and causes fluctuations in both the QEPAS signal level and the characteristics of the quartz tuning fork (QTF), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> accelerates CH<sub>4</sub> relaxation without inducing significant shifts in the QTF frequency. Firstly, the catalytic effect of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> molecules on the CH<sub>4</sub> relaxation process was analyzed. Systematic investigations revealed that increasing C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> concentration enhances CH<sub>4</sub>-QEPAS signal intensity in three distinct phases: rapid growth, gradual saturation, and eventual stabilization. At 6000 ppm C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, the CH<sub>4</sub>-QEPAS signal amplitude increased by 2.53-fold compared to the situation without C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-enhanced CH<sub>4</sub>-QEPAS system maintained excellent linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9999) across 1000-12,000 ppm CH<sub>4</sub>. Allan deviation analysis confirmed a minimum detection limit (MDL) of 540 ppb at 1000 s average time, demonstrating excellent long-term stability. This work not only provides a robust strategy for CH<sub>4</sub> detection but also expands the application of QEPAS in gas relaxation dynamics modulation, highlighting C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> as a superior relaxation promoter for other molecules with a slow relaxation rate.",

      "content": "Deep learning-based computer-generated holography is a promising method for achieving high-quality holographic displays. However, most existing methods are restricted to extracting features from fixed spatial or frequency domains for generating phase-only holograms (POHs), resulting in the loss of finer details in holographic imaging. To overcome this limitation, we propose a complex-valued fractional Fourier network (CFrFNet) that integrates the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) within a unified spatial-frequency framework to produce high-fidelity POHs. A fractional Fourier neural module (FrFNM) is designed to access arbitrary fractional domains between the spatial and frequency domains after a FrFT. To accommodate the characteristics of the fractional domain, a multiscale feature extraction block (MFEB) is proposed to extract rich spatial-frequency joint features. We also introduced a learnable strategy to adaptively optimize the fractional order of the FrFT during the training process.",
