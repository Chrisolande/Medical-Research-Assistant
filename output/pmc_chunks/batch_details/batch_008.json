However, the factors that influence the diffraction efficiency of the diffractive surfaces have not been well understood. Taking advantage of a simplified physics-driven neural network model and two-photon nanolithography (TPN) technology, we theoretically and experimentally investigated the factors that influence the diffraction efficiency of the diffractive surfaces, such as diffraction propagation distances and a variety of diffraction patterns with different geometrical features, the result of which enables the generation of two-dimensional images with high diffraction efficiencies through the diffractive surfaces with a thickness of less than 1 μm and a size of 100 μm by 100 μm.",

By combining multiple phosphors (cyan (C), green (G), yellow (Y), red (R), and deep red (D)) with appropriate concentrations, we could achieve a full spectrum with a flat peak. The developed light source has the ability to accomplish correlated color temperature (CCT) from 6000 to 4000 K (cool white to warm white), with color rendering indices (CRIs) >97, luminous efficacy >100 lm/W, and blue hazard efficiency ≤0.15.

The location and length of the attenuation event are precisely recognized according to the demodulated positions of the two correlation peaks. The spatial resolution is only determined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the autocorrelation curve of chaotic lasers, which breaks through the limitation of wide pulse width on spatial resolution. The proof-of-concept experimental results show that when the pulse width is 1 μs and the detector bandwidth is 130 MHz, the spatial resolution is improved from 100 m to 0.87 m compared with conventional single-pulse OTDR.",

The alloy composition-gradient approach is able to generate polarization bulk charges that favor the polarization self-screening effect to reduce the electric field at heterojunctions. This on the one hand suppresses the quantum confined Stark effect to increase the stimulated recombination rate in the active region. On the other hand, the Al-gradient design enables the decreased electron leakage level. Our results show that the -3 dB bandwidth can be improved either when the stimulated radiative recombination lifetime gets decreased or the escape time for electrons becomes long. As a result, the -3 dB bandwidth can be mostly increased by both decreasing the electron leakage level and increasing the stimulated radiative recombination rate.",

The addition of PbX<sub>2</sub> ligands has been observed to effectively reduce the Stokes shift of PbS QDs with increasing atomic radius of the halide, suggesting that the PbX<sub>2</sub> ligands effectively passivate the surface of the QDs. Further analysis of the morphology and crystal facets of PbS QDs reveals that PbX<sub>2</sub> ligands can induce coupling of the (200) crystal facet. Consequently, the surface passivation and coupling of non-polar crystal facets result in the demonstration of robust resistance to moisture, oxygen, and photobleaching by PbS-PbI<sub>2</sub> QDs.",

A bandpass filter is introduced to remove the nonlinear chirp components induced by both SPM and gain switching. A two-stage compression process is employed to maximize pulse compression and suppress the pulse pedestal. The process begins with linear compression in a passive single-mode fiber, resulting in a 1.2-ps pulse duration, followed by soliton compression in a thulium fiber amplifier. This method produces pulses with an energy of 4.7 nJ and a near transform-limited compressed pulse width of 509 fs. The all-fiberized system shows great potential as a compact, affordable, and robust alternative to mode-locked lasers for ultrafast applications.",

The results show that the Brillouin frequency shift under different temperatures in the Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry remains nearly unaffected by the high-power transmission background, and the optical power transmission efficiency up to ∼66% can be achieved over a 1.3 km fiber link. This work paves the way for further research on the PoF-DOFS hybrid system and gives a valuable solution for creating a multi-parameter, multi-scale sensing network without the need for a local power source.",

This Letter presents a discontinuous DRWSI measurement approach that can automatically predict the missing intensity within the gapped spectrum without requiring any prior knowledge. Therefore, the phase jitters caused by the discontinuities in wavelength scanning can be effectively removed, enabling high-quality reconstruction of the depth-resolved phase maps. Simulation demonstrated that the proposed approach can accurately restore the phase map even when the gap interval is 10 times larger than the entire wavelength-scanning range. Experimental results confirm the robustness of this approach for discontinuous DRWSI measurements under mode-hopping laser outputs. The contribution of this work can alleviate the stringent requirements for the diode laser output, enhancing the flexibility and practicality of DRWSI measurements.",

This allows us to put forth a method to measure the complex permittivity of low-loss dielectrics through the GH shifts. Using this method, the measured permittivity values for Si and GaAs differ from standard values by as little as 0.2% for the real <i>ε</i> component and 7% for the imaginary <i>ε</i> component.

Herein, a scalable electrodeposition method is introduced to construct 3D ZnO/Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on Cu foil (ZOH NSs-Cu foil). Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanowires are first formed via anodization, followed by electroconversion of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. DFT calculations reveal that the ZOH NSs-Cu foil exhibits high Li adsorption energy, imparting strong lithiophilicity and lowering the Li nucleation overpotential. The 3D nanosheet structure provides a large electrochemically active surface, reducing the effective current density. Furthermore, ZOH NSs-Cu foil exhibits low charge transfer resistance and promotes a Li<sub>2</sub>O/LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, further reducing interfacial resistance. SEM analysis and simulations confirm uniform Li deposition on ZOH NSs-Cu foil. In asymmetric cells (1 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), ZOH NSs-Cu foil supports stable cycling for over 400 cycles. Furthermore, a full cell coupling a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) cathode with a Li@ZOH NSs-Cu foil anode retains high capacity with ≈100% Coulombic efficiency over 350 cycles at 1 C, even at an N/P ratio of ≈1.9.",

However, precisely controlling and monitoring how mesoscale assembly dictates final optical properties remain key challenges in designing advanced plasmonic materials. Here, we introduce \"nanoplasmonic isosbestics\" as optical descriptors of the mesoscale organization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on soft templates. Unlike isosbestic points in molecular spectroscopy, which describe chemical equilibria, our numerical simulations demonstrate that nanoplasmonic isosbestics emerge from the coexistence of individual AuNPs and AuNP clusters, where the interparticle spacing determines the isosbestic wavelength. By templating AuNP assembly onto synthetic free-standing lipid bilayers with tunable membrane rigidity, we experimentally achieve precise control over interparticle spacing and prove that it is mirrored by univocal modulation of the isosbestic wavelength.",

Depending on the size, location, and length of the perforation, all patients with dry tympanic membrane perforation who did not have active middle ear disease at the time of presentation were evaluated for hearing loss. A higher proportion of hearing loss was found in the lower age groups. A significant relationship was found between hearing loss and perforation diameter (P = 0.023). A higher proportion of hearing loss was observed at higher perforation diameters. Duration of perforation showed a significant positive correlation between air conduction and duration of perforation (r = 0.205, P = 0.041). Subjects were more likely to have air conduction falling into the 25-40 category compared to <25 at lower age, higher duration, and smaller size. Hearing loss showed that most subjects had air conduction in the range of 25-40 (66%). If the perforation occurs at a lower age, hearing loss is more likely. Hearing loss was significantly associated with the diameter of the perforation (P = 0.023).",

      "content": "The toxicity of PS-MPs, accumulated mainly in the labyrinth zone (LZ), was manifested by some histological alterations of the placental tissue, notably the reduction of the LZ thickness, the disturbance of the oxidative status, and by the apoptosis induction. In addition, exposure to PS-MPs affected placental barrier permeability by reducing gap junction (CX43) and tight junction (ZO1, Claudin 3, and Claudin 4) protein expression as well as by changes in the expression pattern of placental ion transporters with a significant decrease of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase expression versus an increase in that of Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Overall, these findings confirmed the direct toxic effects of PS-MPs on placental tissue and demonstrated, for the first time, that realistic concentrations of human exposure to MPs adversely affected placental barrier permeability in pregnant rats.",

      "content": "Using allometric scaling, we previously identified that adult HGS should be normalized by a cross-sectional or surface area measure of body size, although it is unclear whether scaling youth HGS by the same body size dimension is appropriate. We therefore aimed to (1) identify the optimal body size dimension(s) to normalize youth HGS for differences in body size and (2) generate norm-referenced values for HGS using the identified body size dimension(s). Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative sample of the US non-institutionalized civilian population. Exclusions resulted in a final sample of 4816 youth (51.2% male) aged 6-19 years. Handgrip strength was measured using electronic hand dynamometry. Body size dimensions included body mass, height, and waist circumference. Allometry was used to identify the most appropriate dimension(s) associated with HGS. Population-weighted, sex-stratified generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape were used to develop norms by sex and age. Norms were tabulated as percentile values (3rd to 97th) and visualized as smoothed percentile curves. Predicting HGS using all three body size dimensions (three-dimensional) resulted in collinearity predominantly owing to the presence of waist circumference, prohibiting the use of all three body size dimensions as normalizers. However, collinearity was not an issue when two of the three dimensions (body mass and height) were adopted. Allometry identified a \"generalizable\" normalizing ratio as HGS<sub>n</sub> = <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>H</mi> <mi>G</mi> <mi>S</mi> <mo>/</mo> <mo>(</mo> <msup><mrow><mi>HT</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> <mrow></mrow> <mo>∗</mo> <msup><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>0.333</mn></mrow> </msup> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </math> . If only a single body size dimension were available, then HGS should be normalized using height<sup>2</sup> (i.e., <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>H</mi> <mi>G</mi> <mi>S</mi> <mo>/</mo> <msup><mrow><mi>HT</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> </mrow> </math> ) because height was identified as the strongest single body size dimension associated with HGS.

A significant elevation of proteins such as protein LEG1 homolog, Odontogenesis-associated phosphoprotein, Leucocyte elastase inhibitor, Olfactomedin-like protein 3 and albumin were observed in HSPM-affected enamel, along with upregulation of calcium-binding proteins and immunoglobulins. Evaluation of signalling pathways contributed by the upregulated proteins in HSPM enamel samples was suggestive of increased levels of different components of the immune (defence) system such as raised antibodies (immunoglobulins level), complement coagulation cascade activation, neutrophil and platelet degranulation as well as defence response to bacteria/ fungus.

This study aimed to determine the feasibility of OCT-guided primary PCI and identify the patient population that would benefit most from OCT guidance in STEMI. The ATLAS-OCT trial was a prospective, single-arm, all-comers study conducted at 16 institutions. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of OCT guidance for primary PCI, defined as successful image acquisition (vessel's circumferential or > 270° visualization along > 70% of the lesion's length, as evaluated by an independent core laboratory). A total of 632 patients (mean age: 68.4 years; 80.2% male) were enrolled in the study. OCT-guided PCI was performed in 503 patients, whereas OCT guidance was avoided in 129 patients for patient's condition. Successful image acquisition was achieved in all but seven patients who underwent OCT. The primary endpoint was achieved in 78.5% (496/632) of patients. No procedural complications were associated with OCT. Patients with left main disease (adjusted odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-14.7; p = 0.024), estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) < 30 (3.7; 1.6-8.3; p = 0.002), and Killip IV (2.5; 1.3-4.6; p = 0.003) were significantly avoided for OCT guidance. OCT guidance was feasible in four-fifths of all-comers with STEMI.",

Membrane associated RING finger protein 6 (March6) is implicated in modulating ferroptosis by regulating the stability of related proteins, yet its specific role in tubular epithelial cell ferroptosis and AKI progression remains unknown. This work seeks to clarify the regulatory role of March6 in the ferroptosis of tubular epithelial cells and its involvement in AKI using ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced animal models and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cellular models. Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in March6 expression in renal tissues from IRI mice and H/R cells, accompanied by elevated PTGS2 and reduced GPX4 levels, two ferroptosis marker proteins. Overexpression of March6 in HK-2 cells significantly counteracted Erastin-induced ferroptosis, whereas silencing March6 increased susceptibility. In H/R models, March6 overexpression enhanced cell viability and lowered cell death, reversing ferroptosis-related changes, whereas silencing March6 exhibited the opposite effects. Tubular-specific overexpression of March6 in mice with IRI-induced AKI notably mitigated kidney damage and suppressed ferroptotic changes.",

      "content": "Protozoan Neospora spp. is known to negatively affect horses reared in rural and urban environments, being studied for causing abortion, neonatal mortality and central nervous system disorders in horses. This study aimed to verify the occurrence of anti-Neospora spp. antibodies in horses bred in rural and urban areas from southern Brazil and the risk factors associated with infection. The study consisted of 400 horses, which 241 were bred in rural areas and 159 in urban areas. The detection of serum anti-Neospora spp. antibodies was determined using Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT). The epidemiological questionnaire was applied to owners to determine the factors associated with the infection. The total seropositivity of the animals was 11% (43/400, 95% CI = 7,71-13,78%), distributed into 10% (24/241, 95% CI = 6,18-13,74%) in the rural and 12% (19/159, 95% CI = 6,91 - 16,99%) in the urban group (serum titer ≥ 50). There was no significant difference between rural and urban groups (p = 0.642; OD = 1.31; 95% CI = 0.663-2.58). Stallions and geldings in the rural group were four times more predisposed to presenting anti-Neospora spp. antibodies (p = 0.028; OR = 4.36; 95% CI = 1.164; 14.000). In conclusion, the breeding area is not correlated with seropositivity for Neospora spp. and stallions and geldings raised in rural environments from southern Brazil are more predisposed to infection. There are still poorly elucidated aspects of the infection by Neospora spp.",

In this case report, a 38-year-old male intentionally ingested a large amount of amlodipine and quetiapine resulting in refractory shock despite high doses of vasopressors, calcium, and insulin therapy. After conventional therapies failed, the administration of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II), a vasoconstrictor traditionally used for septic shock, led to a marked improvement in the patient's blood pressure and stabilization of hemodynamics. Sixty minutes after initiation of Ang II, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) improved, allowing for the weaning of other vasopressors and a gradual reduction in insulin therapy. This case highlights the potential role of Ang II as a salvage therapy in polysubstance ingestions when other therapies fail.",

      "content": "Endogenous oxytocin is mainly synthesized by hypothalamic oxytocin neurons and signals through oxytocin receptors (OxtRs). Recent studies with cell type-specific and circuit-specific interrogation have uncovered that oxytocin signals exert pleiotropic neuromodulatory effects through anatomically widespread axonal projections and ubiquitously distributed OxtRs. Dysfunctions of oxytocin signals are closely relevant to brain disorders/diseases. While intranasal oxytocin administration has been demonstrated to be one potential strategy to alleviate some brain disorders/diseases, such as autism, obesity, and anxiety, conflicting clinical outcomes highlight the imperative for precision-targeted neuromodulation strategies. Dissecting the molecular, cellular, and neural circuitry mechanisms underlying oxytocinergic modulation is a prerequisite to achieving this goal. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the oxytocin system in terms of anatomical structure, neuronal modulation, and signal pathways, and discusses the modulatory roles of oxytocin in social, feeding, emotional, and sensory-related brain functions and brain diseases.",

There were 18 males and 32 females who had vitiligo, together with 50 control participants of matched age and gender. Taking GG genotype and G allele as references, MIF GC, CC, (GC + CC) genotypes, and C allele demonstrated a substantially higher occurrence in all patients when compared to controls, with a higher risk of developing vitiligo within healthy control subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the third study worldwide and the first from Egypt to investigate the association between MIF gene polymorphism (rs755622) with vitiligo susceptibility and severity, and it showed that MIF gene polymorphism (rs755622) may be considered a risk factor for vitiligo susceptibility. Moreover, it may be associated with higher disease extent.",

Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) screening algorithm is commonly used and comprises the presence of cardiac symptoms, electrocardiography and conventional echocardiography. In this study, we aimed to test whether the addition of global longitudinal strain and biomarkers (Troponin & NT Pro-BNP) can improve the detection rate of cardiac involvement (AIIMS screening algorithm). A total of 100 patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis were screened for cardiac involvement. This included cardiac symptoms, NT-Pro-BNP levels, Troponin I levels, electrocardiography, and echocardiography including global longitudinal strain (GLS). Patients who were positive for any underwent cardiac MRI or radionuclide cardiac imaging to confirm the presence of cardiac sarcoidosis. Of the 100 patients screened, 23% had cardiac symptoms, 23% had ECG changes, 16% had abnormalities on conventional echocardiography, 32% of patients had abnormal GLS, 16% and 19% of patients were positive for Troponin I and NT-Pro BNP respectively. The HRS and AIIMS screening algorithms detected cardiac involvement in 24 (24%) and 32 (32%) of patients, respectively. Among these patients, 23/24 and 30/32 were confirmed to have cardiac involvement by advanced cardiac imaging. Thus, the AIIMS screening algorithm increased detection of cardiac involvement by 30%. The proposed AIIMS screening algorithm enhances the detection of cardiac involvement in patients with sarcoidosis and should be tested in a larger study.",

This creative engagement explores how and why I tried making my own folding almanacs, using modern materials, and what I learned when one of these was accepted for Un-boxing, an international travelling exhibition. These ancient folding almanacs encapsulate a world view where people's lived experiences of being in a body was held within a flow of relationships with other bodies, human and non-human including animals, the moon, stars and planets. A close reading of the visual and material languages I used in this remaking offers insights into a personal health history folded into bigger questions of what we might allow into an expanded field of 'medicine'.",

While ELISA results revealed differences in antigen recognition among isolates, these differences were not consistent at the species level. The number of bands identified in the immunoblotting varied among the isolates, with certain antigens, such as those from Pb01, a P. lutzii isolate, being less recognized across groups. We also observed overall differences in IgG avidity toward the CFA antigens. Notably, higher avidity was observed for the ~ 70 kDa antigen when compared to other antigens such as 79, 64, 54 and 43 kDa, the latter being gp43, the most studied and widely used glycoprotein for paracoccidioidomycosis immunodiagnosis.",

A total of 24 physicochemical parameters were analyzed. Water quality classifications were assigned based on threshold values from the European Union (EU), World Health Organization (WHO), and Turkey's Surface Water Quality Regulation (TSWQR). The results revealed that Kirazlı Stream, categorized as Class I water quality, is suitable for use. The order of the mean values of cations were as follows: Na<sup>+</sup> > Ca<sup>2+</sup> > Mg<sup>2+</sup> > K<sup>+</sup> (39.14, 14.09, 12.45, and 5.95; mg/L), and order of anions: SO₄<sup>2-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > NO₃<sup>-</sup> > PO₄<sup>3-</sup> (34.66, 7.48, 1.72, and 0.02; mg/L). Indices such as WQI (weighted arithmetic water quality index), HEI, HPI, and ERI indicated excellent to good water quality, whereas SAR and Na% indices supported its usability for irrigation purposes. However, the MH index suggested unsuitability for irrigation. Moreover, 25% of the sampling points met irrigation standards in terms of KR, while 75% did not. Potential health risks for both adults and children were below the threshold (HI < 1). Statistical approaches, including Spearman correlation, PCA and HCA, were employed to assess the physicochemical datasets representing water quality. This study is the first study conducted in the region to evaluate the water quality of the Kirazlı Stream and is an important reference for optimizing resource use and promoting sustainable water management.",

However, among aging societies, treatment indications and decisions in older patients with severe-grade aSAH (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies [WFNS] grade IV or V) remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to identify the risk factors associated with poor outcomes in non-older and older patients with severe-grade aSAH. We analyzed a database of patients with aSAH treated between April 2007 and December 2019 in Japan and divided them into either the non-older (< 75 years) or older group (age ≥ 75 years) to identify factors associated with poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score [mRS] 3-6) at discharge. The data analyzed included patient demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, Fisher group, WFNS grade, treatment method, and mRS score at discharge. Among the 5,095 patients, 1,303 (986 non-older and 317 older) were classified as having severe-grade aSAH. In non-older patients, chronological age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.05) and Fisher groups 3 and 4 were associated with poor outcomes as compared with Fisher group 1 + 2 (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.59-5.58 and OR, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.86-10.54, respectively). However, chronological age and Fisher groups 3 and 4 were not associated with poor outcomes in older patients with severe-grade aSAH. This study suggests that outcomes in older patients with severe-grade aSAH cannot be predicted in the same manner as in non-older patients. Further research on potential prognostic factors, such as biological age, is warranted.",

Litter moisture and pH were lower (p < 0.05) in treated litter than the control. Litter ammonia gas of 28.66 observed in control litter was higher (p < 0.05) than the 18.50, 17.00, 16.66, 12.50 and 13.65 recorded in T2-T6. TVC value of 0.83 × 10<sup>7</sup> and salmonella value of 1.53 × 10<sup>7</sup> obtained in control litter were the highest (p < 0.05) across the treatments. Serum cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride were higher (p < 0.05) in treated groups, while the serum liver enzymes and bilirubin values were also lower (p < 0.05) in treated groups compared to control. In summary, the study observed that dietary sodium bentonite and litter treated with aluminum sulfate improved the litter quality without any damaging impact on the growth performance and serum biochemical parameters of the birds.

Preoperative botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection has emerged as a novel intervention to optimize fascial closure by reducing abdominal wall muscle tension, facilitating surgical repair, and potentially decreasing postoperative complications. To evaluate the effect of preoperative BTX-A injection on fascial closure rates, postoperative complications, hernia recurrence, and hospital length of stay in patients undergoing repair of giant incisional hernias. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies assessing the outcomes of BTX-A injection in the management of giant incisional hernias were included. The primary outcomes were the rate of complete fascial closure and hernia recurrence. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Five articles were selected and included in this systematic review. BTX-A injections showed a positive trend toward improved fascial closure in certain studies, although global analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences compared to controls (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.90-1.01). There was no significant effect on hernia recurrence (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.64-1.49). However, BTX-A significantly reduced postoperative complications (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50-0.88), with no meaningful reduction in the length of hospital stay (MD = -0.72 days; 95% CI: -1.8 to 0.36). Preoperative BTX-A injection is a safe adjunct but has not shown significant benefits in improving fascial closure or reducing hernia recurrence. Although it reduces postoperative complications, its overall clinical impact is limited.",

In this paper, we use molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the binding energies and XRD of CL-20/DNAN cocrystals with different ratios to prove that there is a new type of cocrystal structure between CL-20 and DNAN. To further investigate the effect of moisture absorption on the storage safety of cocrystals, this paper simulates the adsorption process of water molecules on the (0 0 1), (0 1 0), (1 0 0) crystal surfaces, respectively. By analyzing the radial distribution function plots, it is found that there are hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and molecules on the surface of the cocrystal, and the (1 0 0) face is most likely to adsorb water molecules. By analyzing the length of the triggering bond and the cohesive energy density of the cocrystal, it was found that when water molecules are absorbed on the surface, the N-NO2 bond of the cocrystal explosive is more likely to be broken and the sensitivity of the explosive is higher on the surface, leading to increased sensitivity. The MD simulation is conducted utilizing the Materials Studio software, operating under the NPT set with a temperature of 298 K, a pressure of 0.0001 GPa, temperature control of Andersen, and pressure control of Berendsen.",

The patient's symptoms included chronic intermittent upper abdominal pain, postprandial bilious vomiting, significant weight loss, and anorexia. The diagnosis was established through imaging and endoscopic biopsy, revealing a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Following preoperative optimization, the patient underwent subtotal radical gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction with D2 lymphadenectomy. Histopathology confirmed poorly cohesive gastric carcinoma (signet ring cell type) with extensive lymph node metastasis (pT4a pN3a M0).

While sport-associated injuries predominate in young adults, the incidence of osteoporotic fractures greatly increases in older patients. Despite established treatment strategies, complications such as wound healing disorders, infections, neurovascular injuries, malalignment, pseudarthrosis and implant failure are frequent. An effective complication management requires detailed knowledge of the morphological features of fractures, individual risk factors and differentiated revision strategies. With the presentation of two clinical cases, we aim to highlight the necessity of individualized treatment concepts. Due to the increasing number of war casualties transferred for secondary treatment to Central Europe, the likelihood of encountering unfamiliar injury patterns, such as blast or gunshot wounds, is rising. This development presents new challenges in daily clinical practice. Physiotherapeutic and occupational therapy support play a central role in achieving favorable functional outcomes following revision surgery for diaphyseal fractures of the upper extremities. In geriatric care, orthogeriatric concepts have significantly decreased mortality and improved mobilization as well as self-sufficiency among older patients.",

      "content": "This chapter introduces an innovative approach to SDR, utilizing crescendo single-pulse evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP) interpretation for rootlet selection. The method combines preoperative spastic muscle identification, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, and a precise stimulation protocol to guide the selective sectioning of sensory nerve roots. The chapter outlines the setup for crescendo single-pulse stimulation-guided SDR, including preoperative muscle group identification, intraoperative monitoring channels, and surgical approach. It details the stimulation protocol and defines criteria for motor nerves, sphincter-associated sensory nerves, and lower limb-associated sensory nerves based on evoked CMAP patterns. The concept of a \"rhizotomy ratio\" is introduced as a potential metric correlating with the severity of the patient's condition. Midterm outcomes of this approach are presented, based on a cohort of 481 cases with a minimum 2-year follow-up across all 5 levels of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Results show muscle tone decreased by an average of 1.0 level in spastic muscle groups immediately after surgery, with a tendency to continue reducing by an additional 0.8 level in the following 2 years post-SDR. Motor function improved significantly, with 39.1% of patients advancing by one or two GMFCS levels (in 432 cases with preop GMFCS levels II-V), concurrent with intensive rehabilitation programs. The greatest improvements were observed in children who underwent surgery before age six and those with less severe preoperative motor impairments. The chapter also discusses postoperative rehabilitation strategies tailored to the gradual reduction in muscle tone experienced by children following SDR. Gait analysis in mild cases indicates improved walking patterns post-SDR. Overall, this crescendo single-pulse stimulation-guided SDR approach demonstrates promising outcomes in reducing spasticity and improving motor function in children with cerebral palsy, with minimal complications reported.",

      "content": "Existing literature on SDR extensively discusses its utility in cerebral palsy (CP)-associated spasticity management. There is a void on the utility and guidance in patient selection for SDR in pediatric patients with non-CP-related spasticity. A systematic review was performed on studies describing SDR outcomes in pediatric patients identified from Medline and Embase databases. Publications between January 1970 and August 2023 were included. Combinations of search terms \"selective dorsal rhizotomy,\" \"selective posterior rhizotomy,\" and \"spasticity\" were utilized. Pediatric patient studies with clinical data on spasticity, ambulation, procedural variables, and follow-up outcomes were included. Articles including patients without cerebral palsy as a primary diagnosis were reviewed in detail for outcomes after intervention. A total of 114 publications were identified, and of these, 11 fit inclusion criteria for a total of 127 patients. Most common non-CP etiologies for spasticity included hereditary spastic paraparesis (27.8%, n = 34), congenital syndrome (n = 7), and spinal cord injury (21.9%, n = 6). Compared to their baseline, SDR in non-CP-related etiologies demonstrated tone normalization (93%, n = 43 out of 45 patients) in most and improvement in ambulation (49.2%, n = 58 out of 118 patients) in a significant proportion of patients. This systematic review on SDR in pediatric patients revealed effective spasticity control and improvement in ambulatory functionality in selected patients without cerebral palsy. Appropriate patient selection is keystone in achieving sustained benefits in functionality and quality of life.",

      "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the onset and progression of Atherosclerosis (AS). The ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein (UQCRB) is an essential subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The objective of this study was to investigate whether UQCRB improves endothelial dysfunction in AS by upregulating cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A (COX5A), thereby regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism, reducing inflammation, and preventing apoptosis. To explore the biological role of UQCRB in AS, we found that UQCRB was significantly downregulated in AS, based on bioinformatics analysis and clinical patient data. In vitro, overexpression of UQCRB significantly increased COX5A protein expression in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL), enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, boosted ATP production, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, was decreased, and the apoptosis rate was significantly reduced. Additionally, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was lowered, while the level of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was increased. The small molecule compound Terpestacin targeting UQCRB down-regulated the expression of COX5A in the AS mouse model, exacerbated endothelial dysfunction, and increased inflammation.",

      "content": "This retrospective study included 100 patients who underwent surgery for primary osteoarthritis. Patients diagnosed with conditions other than primary knee OA and those with incomplete or poor-quality imaging were excluded. Patients were categorized into four groups by the degree of intraoperative coronal knee alignment correction: Group 1 (< 10° varus, n = 37), Group 2 (≥ 10° varus, n = 30), Group 3 (< 10° valgus, n = 18), and Group 4 (≥ 10° valgus, n = 15). Hip-knee-ankle angle, tibial plafond inclination, talar inclination, tibiotalar tilt, and subtalar varus-valgus angle, were measured preoperatively and postoperatively on full-length, standing, anteroposterior X-ray images. TKA resulted in postoperative changes in all measured angles regardless of the degree of varus/valgus correction. Notably, ≥ 10° valgus correction led to statistically significant postoperative alterations in ankle and subtalar alignment: tibial plafond inclination from 84.9 to 89.5° (Δ 4.6, range,1.5-7.8, P <.01), tibiotalar tilt from 83.1 to 89.3° (Δ 6.2, range,1.1-9.6, P =.02), and subtalar varus-valgus angle from 66.4 to 72.6° (Δ 6.2, range,1.9-12.1, P <.01). While knee deformity correction during TKA generally realigns the ankle and subtalar joint, our study has shown that large valgus knee correction (≥ 10°) during TKA significantly alters ankle and subtalar joint alignment. Thus, potentially leading to unfavorable postoperative outcomes in patients with abnormal or stiff joints. We recommend that future studies investigate the long-term effects of large valgus knee corrections during TKA on ankle and subtalar joint alignment and their impact on postoperative outcomes.",

Hyperphosphorylated tau species (p-tau), particularly p-tau217 and p-tau181, show promise in distinguishing PSP and CBS from other neurodegenerative diseases, though not from each other. While serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) exhibit limited individual utility, their combination with p-tau species enhances diagnostic accuracy. Other genome-associated, inflammatory, metabolic biomarkers, and neuropeptides yield interesting though inconsistent results. The majority of serum biomarkers yielded non-specific results in differentiating PSP and/or CBS from each other and from other related neurodegenerative diseases. Future large-scale, multi-center studies with autopsy confirmation in early-stage patients are essential for developing reliable biomarker panels.",

      "content": "The aim of this study was to assess the potential of the novel SSTR-targeting tracer [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE in diagnosing PPGL by comparing imaging parameters to tumor marker levels and secretory activity in a small cohort of patients diagnosed with this rare tumor type. This retrospective study included 34 patients with histologically confirmed PPGL who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE-PET/CT at LMU University Hospital Munich between 10/2020 and 02/2024 as well as hormonal laboratory analysis within up to 100 days. Imaging parameters - standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion uptake (TLU) - were analyzed. Uptake was normalized to liver background (SUVmaxr, SUVmeanr). Radioligand uptake of biochemical subtypes and genotypes was compared with Mann-Whitney-U test. Correlation was tested using Spearman´s rank correlation test. The patient-based detection rate of [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE-PET was 96.6%. A moderate correlation was found between MTV and TLU with chromogranin A (r = 0.570-0.608, p < 0.005) and with biochemical secretion (r = 0.466-0.576, p < 0.05). Hereditary PPGL with Cluster 1 genotype showed stronger [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE uptake compared to sporadic PPGL (SUVmeanr: p = 0.032; SUVmaxr: p = 0.051). A subgroup comparison with [⁶⁸Ga]Ga-DOTATOC-PET/CT revealed no significant difference in uptake metrics or tumor-to-background ratios. This is the first clinical evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE-PET/CT in patients with PPGL. MTV and TLU measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE-PET/CT correlated well with the tumor marker chromogranin A in serum and with (nor)metanephrines in urine and plasma. Within the limits imposed by the small cohort, our results suggest that TLU and MTV in [<sup>18</sup>F]SiTATE-PET/CT could be used as SSTR imaging biomarker for monitoring of disease progression and secretory activity in patients with PPGL.",

Risk models compared were: Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0, Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Calculator, PSA density, U-Net segmentation, and U-Net combined with clinical parameters. The reference standard was histopathology or negative follow-up. Performance metrics were calculated by simulating a triaging workflow compared to radiologist interpreting all exams on a test set of 465 patients. Sensitivity and specificity differences were assessed using the McNemar test. Differences in PPV and NPV were assessed using the Leisenring, Alonzo and Pepe generalized score statistic. Equivalence test p-values were adjusted within each measure using Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Triaging using U-Net with clinical parameters reduced radiologist workload by 12.5% with sensitivity decrease from 93 to 90% (p = 0.023) and specificity increase from 39 to 47% (p < 0.001). This simulated workload reduction was greater than triaging with risk calculators (3.2% and 1.3%, p < 0.001), and comparable to PSA density (8.4%, p = 0.071) and U-Net alone (11.6%, p = 0.762). Both U-Net triaging strategies increased PPV (+ 2.8% p = 0.005 clinical, + 2.2% p = 0.020 nonclinical), unlike non-U-Net strategies (p > 0.05). NPV remained equivalent for all scenarios (p > 0.05). Clinically-informed U-Net triaging correctly ruled out 20 (13.4%) radiologist false positives (12 PI-RADS = 3, 8 PI-RADS = 4). Of the eight (3.6%) false negatives, two were misclassified by the radiologist. No misclassified case was interpreted as PI-RADS 5. Prostate MRI triaging using machine learning could reduce radiologist workload by 12.5% with a 3% sensitivity decrease and 8% specificity increase, outperforming triaging using non-imaging-based risk models. Further prospective validation is required.",

      "content": "This highlights the urgent need for effective antidotes in the management of toxicological emergencies. Antidotes, defined as therapeutic agents that counteract the effects of poisons, drugs, or toxins, play a critical role in toxicology. Their mechanisms of action include altering toxicokinetics, halting absorption, neutralizing toxins, or inhibiting harmful metabolic conversions. This review delves into the historical development of antidotes, their categorization, recommended dosages, indications, contraindications, and potential side effects. It also explores the concept of antidote banking, a strategic approach to ensure the availability of antidotes during emergencies. Understanding these aspects is vital for healthcare professionals in managing acute, unintentional, or self-poisoning cases effectively, especially among young adults. The historical evolution from Mithridatism, the first known antidote, to modern, evidence-based antidotes demonstrates significant advancements in medical science. Antidotes are categorized based on their mechanisms, including toxic effect bypass, inert complex formation, accelerated detoxification, reduced toxic conversion, receptor site blockade, and receptor site competition. In addition, they are classified by their site of action: serological, pharmacological, mechanical, physical, and chemical. Antidote banking, endorsed by the World Health Organization, emphasizes the need for a reliable supply of critical, emergency, and urgent antidotes to manage poisoning incidents efficiently. This comprehensive review provides valuable insights into antidote development and application, contributing to enhanced public health responses to toxicological emergencies.",

Despite the availability of effective prevention programs, their consistent implementation remains limited, highlighting the need for strategies to improve delivery and reduce costs. The reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and system modelling can help in understanding and improvement of the implementation and maintenance of public health initiatives. This research used a system dynamics model to explore hypothetical pathways between reach, maintenance, and the cost-related components of implementation within the RE-AIM framework. Scenarios explored the influence of strategies for enhancing reach and maintenance and the resulting impact on participation and cost. Scenarios that considered alternative pathways to engagement (i.e. enhanced reach strategies) and re-engagement led to higher participation rates by utilising alternative pathways and reducing dependence on initial reach. However, this increased overall program costs due to the population cycling between engagement and disengagement. This modelling study highlights the complex non-linear relationships that affect the implementation of public health prevention, emphasising the need for support strategies to maintain engagement. The study shows that while alternative pathways to reach can improve participation, disengagement remains a significant challenge, impacting overall costs. Sustainment strategies that are both effective and cost-efficient are crucial for maintaining engagement and enhancing the effectiveness of public health programs.",

This report narrates our experience in the management of a 6-year-old child with a colocolic megacolon intussusception. It was characterized by a subtle history of chronic constipation and solid diet intolerance. Long-standing colicky abdominal pain was interpreted as a food allergy, and this was a critical clinical miss. Radiographical megacolon appearance on X-ray was misinterpreted as a dilated gastric shadow. Ultrasound evaluation was diagnostic, but this could not distinguish the PLP. Surgical intervention was planned for ileocolic intussusception; however, a colocolic intussusception was encountered, and an inappropriate intraoperative decision to perform a pry colo-colonic anastomosis was taken. Atypical septic-induced persistent bradycardia and severe lethargy were danger signs of anastomotic leakage that necessitated a re-exploration laparotomy and a lifesaving diverting colostomy.",

      "content": "In a secondary analysis of those findings, we examined four broad measures of genetic risk-polygenic scores (PGS)-of problematic alcohol use (PAU), drinks per week (DPW), and time to relapse to any drinking (TR) and heavy drinking (THR) as moderators of topiramate's effect on HDDs and alcohol-related problems. We analyzed data from 285 individuals with AUD (65.6% male) of European-like ancestry, who were treated with either topiramate (49.1%) or placebo (50.9%). All patients underwent genome-wide array genotyping, and PGS were calculated using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of PAU, DPW, and TR and THR (two time-to-event outcomes among patients treated in AUD pharmacotherapy trials). We hypothesized an interaction effect in which greater genetic risk-particularly for PAU-would be associated with a greater therapeutic response to topiramate than placebo. As shown previously, topiramate significantly reduced both HDDs (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50, p < 0.001) and Short Index of Problems (SIP) scores (b = -3.04, p < 0.001) more than placebo. There were nonsignificant associations of higher PGS with more HDDs (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98-1.41, p = 0.091) and a greater reduction in HDDs in the topiramate group (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.62-1.03, p = 0.089). There were also significant interaction effects with treatment on SIP score by PGS for PAU (b = -1.64, SE = 0.78, p = 0.033), TR (b = -2.16, SE = 0.72, p = 0.003), and TRH (b = -2.17, SE = 0.72, p = 0.003). These findings provide proof of principle for the use of alcohol-related PGS as moderators of the effects of topiramate for treating AUD. Larger RCTs of topiramate are needed to provide adequate statistical power to validate this pharmacogenetic approach to precision AUD treatment.",

      "content": "Osteogenesis, which refers to the formation of bone tissue, can be studied in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms of bone development, identify key factors and cytokines, and enhance potential regenerative medicine applications in tissue engineering and transplantation. Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are particularly promising for these studies due to their capacity to differentiate into various mesodermal lineage cells, including osteoblasts. To induce osteogenic differentiation, ASCs are cultured in a complete growth medium (CGM) supplemented with β-glycerophosphate, ascorbate-2-phosphate and dexamethasone over a period of at least 3 weeks. Osteogenic differentiation can be assessed through the deposition of hydroxyapatite, a key component of mineralized bone matrix, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme crucial for matrix calcification. This study provides a protocol for differentiating ASCs into osteoblasts using osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM) and evaluating the differentiation using Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays. The methodology includes the preparation of CGM and ODM, as well as the specific procedures for ARS staining and ALP activity assays. The ARS staining involves fixation of cells, staining, and quantification of hydroxyapatite deposition, while the ALP assay measures enzyme activity. Both assays are normalized to cell counts, determined through DAPI staining and microscopic analysis.",

      "content": "Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (AdEVs), like other types of extracellular vesicles (EVs), are released from their donor parental cells in varying sizes and large quantities. During this process, diverse cargos are often internalized in the lumen or covalently attached on the surface of these EVs, allowing for their horizontal transfer from adipocytes to non-adipocyte cells. Hence, AdEVs can promote the ability of adipocytes to remodel the tumor microenvironment in cancers affecting, among others, breast and colon tissues by acting as mediators of cell-to-cell communication through the release of bioactive molecules. Cancer-associated adipocytes, for instance, can promote tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance by secreting AdEVs carrying oncogenic microRNAs, cytokines, and chemokines, which interact with signaling pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT) that lead to tumor formation and cancerous behavior. As the importance of EVs in these processes rapidly gains attention, a reliable method of isolating AdEVs also becomes highly essential.",

Adipose tissue samples are initially washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove blood contaminants. Tissue is then digested enzymatically with type I collagenase under controlled temperature and agitation to release the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) containing AD-MSCs. The enzyme activity is neutralized using complete growth medium followed by centrifugation to separate the cell pellet from unwanted material. The resulting cell pellet is resuspended and filtered to eliminate residual tissue fragments. After seeding the cells in culture, AD-MSCs in the SVF are characterized by adherence to plastic and the expression of specific cell surface marker (e.g., CD73, CD90, CD105), confirming their identity. This protocol provides a method for isolating viable AD-MSCs for downstream applications.",

Monitoring metabolic alterations during adipogenic differentiation can be achieved through the assessment of extracellular flux parameters, such as the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). In this study, we provide a comprehensive protocol for differentiating hMSCs into the adipogenic lineage, with an emphasis on tracking differentiation stages through extracellular flux measurements. We determined the cellular metabolic status throughout the adipogenic differentiation by assessing OCR and ECAR to gauge mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activity, respectively, using a Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer.",

This chapter elucidates a comprehensive 22-day protocol designed for the differentiation of the hESC cell line H9 toward the adipogenic lineage. During the initial phase, we initiate the differentiation process by forming embryoid bodies (EBs). This is achieved by culturing hESCs in an ultralow attachment plate for a duration of 12 days, during which the EBs are exposed to retinoic acid (RA) for a period of 3 days. Subsequently, adipocyte induction is facilitated by transferring EBs onto Geltrex-coated 6-well plates and subjecting them to adipogenic differentiation medium for an additional 10 days. To assess the successful internalization of lipids within the adipocytes, we employ Oil Red O staining. This protocol provides a robust framework for studying adipogenesis from pluripotent stem cells, offering insights into the intricate process of adipocyte development and serving as a valuable tool for related research endeavors.",

      "content": "Although probiotics can modulate immune cell function and secrete antineoplastic metabolites, their clinical application is hindered by inherently poor motility and the accumulation of detrimental metabolites within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a biohybrid nanodevice is designed, which can serve as an adaptive \"nano-engine\" and \"TME-regulator\" by engineering clinically relevant probiotics. The Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) can secrete anticancer compounds but is restricted by non-motility and detrimental metabolites, such as hydrogen peroxide and glutathione in the TME. These engineered probiotics with Janus structure are prepared by asymmetrically modifying Lr surfaces with PEGylated Fe/Co/Cu/W nanoparticles (Fcw) via electrostatic interactions. With catalase-like and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)-degrading activity, Fcw enables the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and GSNO to generate oxygen and nitric oxide, propelling Lr to overcome complex biological barriers while reducing local hydrogen peroxide levels to enhance Lr survival. Importantly, Fcw with glutathione peroxidase-like activity can enhance the oxidative stress induced by Lr, thereby improving the anticancer activity of probiotics. Therefore, the design can not only enhance the Lr motility to increase tumor infiltration but also modulate the TME to improve probiotic viability and efficiency.",

At baseline, among All participants, greater gamma dysregulation (higher resting gcoh) positively correlated with greater WM impairment. Among Active participants, completing gcoh-NFB training lowered the elevated baseline gcoh in participants with lower baseline WM function, and, conversely, increased the relatively lower baseline gcoh in participants with higher baseline WM function. In contrast, completing placebo-NFB produced no gcoh changes, regardless of baseline WM function. Compared to Placebo participants, all Active participants exhibited improved WM with training. The differing gcoh responses to NFB among Active participants suggested multiple neurophysiologic and WM responses during treatment. We selected canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to further evaluate potential latent and divergent responses. CCA identified two statistically significant canonical components; the stronger component representing the expected positive interactions between training-related WM responses, and the weaker component representing diverging interactions between training-related NFB and WM responses. Coefficients for the stronger (but not the weaker) component efficiently separated participants into distinct clusters with high, versus low, baseline WM, suggesting this response as the primary driver of divergent yet equally therapeutic effects observed for patients with low or high baseline WM function.",

Baseline LFA was determined in 76 adults with normal cervical alignment. LFA was then analyzed in 155 DCM patients and categorized into enlarging (eLFA), normal (nLFA), and decreasing LFA (dLFA) groups. Cervical spine parameters and MRI findings were compared, and multiple linear regression identified factors associated with LFA changes. Static LFA on MRI and dynamic LFA (ΔLFA) on X-ray were evaluated for detecting cervical instability. The mean LFA in normal subjects (C2/3 to C6/7) was 76.3 ± 7.2°, varying by segment and age. The LFA was significantly reduced in DCM patients (70.7 ± 11.6°). The spinal cord diameter of the adjacent vertebrae and the increased signal intensity were significant difference among eLFA, nLFA and dLFA groups. LFA correlated with vertebral body movement (β = - 3.361, P < 0.001) and cervical disc angle (β = - 0.774, P < 0.001). The static LFA cutoff for posterior slippage was 67.6°, and △LFA for instability was 12.3°. Posterior cervical spine misalignment in DCM is closely linked to both horizontal and angular vertebral displacements, potentially exacerbating spinal cord injury. Static and dynamic LFA measurements provide valuable supplementary parameters for the accurate assessment of cervical instability.",

      "content": "Participants with and without psychotic vulnerability were compared in terms of several clinical features, assessed before and after cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We examined whether psychotic vulnerability predicted outcome of CBT. Psychotic vulnerability was identified in 41.6% of the Scandinavian and 34.4% of the North American sample. In both samples, participants with psychotic vulnerability had poorer psychosocial functioning and more depressive symptoms at baseline. In the Scandinavian sample those with psychotic vulnerability had poorer psychosocial functioning and more severe anxiety symptoms post-treatment. In the Scandinavian sample, psychotic vulnerability was linked to the symmetry/hoarding dimension, while in the North American sample it was linked to the ordering and contamination-cleaning dimensions at baseline, and only to the contamination-cleaning dimension after treatment. Importantly, psychotic vulnerability did not predict CBT outcome in any of the samples. Our findings show that an in-depth second-level assessment of psychosis risk is merited in many cases of youth with OCD and suggest that treatment gains following CBT for pediatric OCD are similar in those with and without psychotic vulnerability.",

We used actuarial techniques to model scenarios of disability costs associated with PAH, with and without treatment with sotatercept, a first-in-class therapy that slowed PAH disease progression in clinical trials. Annual disability costs were measured as the net present value of lifetime benefits per claimant with PAH and multiplied by the number of new disability insurance claimants with PAH nationwide each year. We estimated that sotatercept therapy would result in disability benefit costs savings in the US ranging from $86.9 to $245.5 million per year or 32-90% of current costs for LTD and SSDI benefits associated with PAH. Our findings suggest that therapies that potentially prevent disability and enable disabled patients to return to work can help reduce disability costs.",

      "content": "Despite its low incidence, the increasing number of women with breast implants necessitates vigilance among clinicians and pathologists. BIA-ALCL presents in situ and invasive forms, with varying prognoses. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend cytology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry (FCM) for diagnosis. This retrospective study analyzed 16 periprosthetic fluid (PF) samples from suspected lymphoma cases between January 2018 and January 2024. Cytological and immunological analyses were performed using May Grünwald-Giemsa staining, and FCM with BD FACSCanto II and BD LYRIC cytometers. A 10 or 12-colour FCM panel including pan-T markers and CD30 was used. Of the 16 samples, 2 cases were diagnosed with BIA-ALCL. BIA-ALCL cases showed atypical CD4+ T-cells with large size and loss of CD3 and CD7. In contrast, the 14 reactive cases did not exhibit atypical cells. Key challenges included sample volume limitations, cell dilution, and distinguishing neoplastic cells from reactive ones, particularly in cases with low cell counts. FCM, combined with an extensive panel of pan-T markers and CD30, effectively differentiates anaplastic BIA-ALCL cells from reactive seroma. However, it should complement, not replace, traditional diagnostic methods. Recognizing pitfalls and correlating FCM findings with clinical and morphological data enhances diagnostic accuracy. FCM is a valuable tool for diagnosing BIA-ALCL but should be used alongside other methods. Accurate diagnosis depends on understanding sample-specific challenges and integrating FCM results with clinical context.",

It is known that nursing homes with a dementia care unit can provide further training or an expert on person-centredness compared to those with a traditional care unit. It is unclear how the mission statements of these nursing homes differ in terms of their wording of person-centredness. The aim is to investigate how mission statements of nursing homes that provide different types of care units describe person-centred care. We conducted a document analysis of mission statements from German nursing homes from a dataset of the survey study on specialized care for people living with dementia in nursing homes (BeStaDem Survey Study). The nursing homes that provided the mission statements had different care units, including traditional care units and dementia care units. The mission statements were deductively-inductively analysed using content analysis. We analysed 60 mission statements of different nursing homes and identified main categories that include aspects of person-centred care. In particular, mission statements of nursing homes with dementia care units describe combinations of central aspects of person-centred care that mission statements of nursing homes with a traditional care unit without dementia-specific focus do not describe. The variation of different understandings or concepts often becomes evident in mission statements.",

Among them, 242 (58.31%) were diagnosed before pregnancy, while 173 (41.69%) were diagnosed during pregnancy, resulting in a preconception diabetes awareness rate of 58.31%. Education level was significantly associated with the timing of diabetes diagnosis (P = 0.002). In addition, women diagnosed during pregnancy had significantly higher HbA1c levels before delivery when compared with those diagnosed before pregnancy (6.70% vs. 6.20%, P < 0.001), indicating more severe glycemic dysregulation. Consequently, this group also exhibited a higher rate of diabetes-related hospitalizations during pregnancy (42.77% vs. 22.73%, P < 0.001) and an increased risk of macrosomia (20.23% vs. 10.74%, P = 0.007). Pregnant women diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy exhibited more severe perinatal glucose metabolism disorders and a higher rate of macrosomia. Early diagnosis and management of diabetes-especially before conception-helped improve perinatal glycemic control, potentially reducing healthcare burdens and the incidence of macrosomia.",

The combined drug sensitivity test <i>in vitro</i> for eravacycline and polymyxin B demonstrated a synergistic effect in 20% of eravacycline-resistant CRKP strains. Carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) is a global priority pathogen due to its limited therapeutic options and high morbidity, which urgently needs new antibiotics that are not affected by common resistance mechanisms. As the next generation of fluorocycline antibiotics, eravacycline can circumvent the tetracycline-specific resistance pathways by its structural modifications, which may be a candidate antibiotic for CRKP infections. The present study evaluated the <i>in vitro</i> activity of eravacycline against CRKP strains, including carbapenemase producers, and explored synergistic interactions with existing antibiotics. By determining the efficacy spectrum and combinatorial potential for eravacycline, this study will directly guide clinical strategies to combat infections caused by CRKP and optimize treatment regimens for high-risk populations.",

Patients' demographic information, comorbidities, medication history, and laboratory data were collected. Physician adherence was defined as a patient with ASCVD receiving an SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA and a patient with CKD or HF receiving an SGLT2i. The baseline characteristics of the adherence and nonadherence groups were compared. Only 28.4% of prescriptions adhered to guidelines. Patients in the physician-adherent group had higher HbA1c levels, body mass index, and age, and more comorbidities. Logistic regression revealed that older age [odds ratio (OR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.014-2.604, P < 0.001], cerebrovascular accident history (OR 1.591, 95% CI 1.357-1.865, P < 0.001), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor use (OR 2.359, 95% CI 2.062-2.700, P < 0.001) were associated with physician nonadherence. Only a suboptimal percentage of patients with diabetes and cardiorenal disease in Taiwan receive SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs despite these medications' recognized cardiorenal benefits. Further action is required to improve physician adherence in patients with greater age, cerebrovascular accident history, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor use.",

During up to 36 years of follow-up, 4,334 new-onset ASCVD events among 49,603 incident cancer cases were documented. After adjusting for shared risk factors, cervical cancer (HR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.06-2.29) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HR: 2.80; 95%CI: 1.89-4.15) was associated with increased risk of ASCVD incidence, while prostate cancer was associated with a lower ASCVD incidence (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85-0.97). Compared to cancer-free individuals, breast cancer survivors experienced lower ASCVD risk during the first 7.5 years but gradually increased afterwards (Pnon-linearity=0.01). The risk of ASCVD increased over time among patients with cancers of the colorectum (P = .003), lung (P = .002), and endometrium (P = .04). No significant association with ASCVD risk was observed for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, sarcoma, melanoma, kidney, thyroid, leukemia, or ovary. Cervical cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma was associated with an increased risk of new-onset ASCVD, independent of shared risk factors, while no increased risk was found with other cancers. ASCVD risk trajectories varied over time after diagnosis according to cancer types.",

The identification of epithelial and stromal cells in these lesions was confirmed by immunostaining of e-cadherin, an endometrial epithelial marker, and Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), an endometrial stromal marker. Our results illustrate successful induction of endometriosis with fluorescent-labeled endometriotic lesions to identify in situ endometriotic lesions. According to the size and physiological similarity of pigs to humans, this is an important first step toward the development of a non-invasive tool to diagnose endometriosis. Furthermore, the availability of a new large animal model for translational endometriosis research provides a novel preclinical animal model for laparoscopic monitoring and retrieval of experimental endometriotic lesions with ample serum for serial analyses.",

Four distinct global risk scores (medical, lifestyle, emotional and quality of life and non-adherence risk scores) were calculated based on the responses to specific groups of questions. 2615 treated hypertensive patients (≥18 years of age) from 5 European countries completed the questionnaire. Mean (SD) age was 69.6 years (5.8); 54% males. Overall, antihypertensive therapy represented a low burden in patients' daily life (2.9/10 in the Likert scale). Perfect self-reported adherence was claimed by 59.8% of participants. Reporting of non-adherence episodes to physicians was low (13% always/often). Participants with a high non-adherence risk score had a greater number of associated diseases (obesity, sleep disturbances, depression, and cardiac complications), a higher treatment-associated burden on daily life, a greater stress level and more antihypertensive pills per day (p < 0.001 for all). No correlation was found between the clinical and lifestyle risk scores and the risk of non-adherence. The emotional score correlated significantly with the non-adherence risk score (p < 001). Comparing patients with a low/middle risk to those with a high risk of non-adherence, female gender and age >65 year were associated with a lower odd ratio of non-adherence whereas depression, stress, family hardships, negative information on drugs and poor information were associated with higher odds of non-adherence. This large survey reveals several underestimated issues regarding patients' perspective in hypertension. It highlights the impact of emotions, exposure to family hardships, and stress on the risk of non-adherence. Non-adherence is underreported by patients; hence it remains mostly unrecognized.",

We used linear regression models to assess association between changes in birthrates and the implementation of ENAPEA. We also calculated the proportion of births that were first versus second- or higher-order births. Overall, about 20% of births in Mexico are to VYA and adolescents, with little change over time. VYA and adolescent births increased or were stable in the pre-ENAPEA (2008-2014) period and declined in the post-ENAPEA period (2015-2019). Small but significant reductions in birthrates for both age groups are associated with the beginning of the implementation of ENAPEA. There were important reductions in the proportion of births that are second order or higher. Our results provide some key insights to help understand declines in adolescent births in the context of ENAPEA, with a particular focus on VYA mothers and a novel insight on first and second-/third-order births.",

Data were collected between August 10, 2022 and February 29, 2024 using a patient information form, a numerical pain severity scale, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the General Comfort Questionnaire-short form. Catheter site pain was assessed 30 minutes after the completion of angiography, and anxiety and comfort levels were assessed 1 hour later. The difference between the types of angiography according to personal characteristics was significant (p < 0.05). The pain severity of patients with transradial angiography was determined to be 4.766 units higher than that of those with femoral angiography (p < 0.002). The difference in median anxiety values according to angiography type was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The anxiety points of the transradial group were 3.227 units higher than those of the femoral group (p < 0.001). The median comfort points of the transradial group were 2.974 units higher than those of the femoral group, which was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The severity of pain, and anxiety and comfort levels of patients undergoing transradial angiography were determined to be higher than those of patients undergoing femoral angiography. This information can be of help to nurses in presenting high-quality care options.",

This study builds on recent advancements by evaluating these biomarkers retrospectively using samples from a clinical pharmacology study that assessed DDI via renal cationic transporters between fedratinib (inhibitor) and metformin (substrate) in healthy participants. Fedratinib reduced renal clearance for all endogenous substrates, with m<sup>1</sup>A (38 %) and NMN (36 %) showing reductions comparable to metformin (40 %), while creatinine exhibited slightly lower (29 %), likely reflecting its limited contribution to transporter-mediated renal tubular secretion. Simulations focused on m<sup>1</sup>A due to its favorable characteristics over NMN, particularly its minimal diurnal and intra-participant variability, demonstrating that reliable DDI assessments can still be achieved despite sampling constraints typical in oncology settings.",

Thus, perturbation or inhibition of this process through the development of advanced inhibitors is crucial for the treatment of AD. Here, we adopted an advanced strategy that showcases the design of a carbazole-based chemical inhibitor targeting the Aβ peptide. The new inhibitors are designed in such a way that they can bind selectively with the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide and inhibit the assembly process and disease progression. Initial assessments using the thioflavin-T assay and molecular docking experiments help screen the carbazole and theophylline-based CT-01 as effective lead molecules, which bind at the N-terminal hydrophobic region of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide and inhibit the formation of soluble oligomers and extracellular fibrillary aggregates.",

Concurrent interventions of intracranial and sinonasal drainage was identified as a factor associated with decreased risk. Although RICs are rare, with decreasing mortality due to progress in imaging and clinical strategies, they remain the most severe complications of rhinosinusitis. Subdural and/or intracerebral abscess, consciousness level at admission, and more than one surgical intervention were found to be risk factors for mortality.

      "content": "While this concept has long been recognized in polymers, its potential application to low-molecular-weight, nonpolymeric compounds has gained attention only recently. In this study, we provide direct evidence supporting this concept among low-molecular-weight glass-formers by comparing the thermal and dynamic properties of structurally related 1,2-bis(2-halogenethylthio)-4-methylbenzene and ester derivatives of 1,2-bis(2-hydroxyethylthio)-4-methylbenzene. We show that increasing molar mass through a simple atom substitution without altering intermolecular interactions, such as exchanging chlorine for bromine, decelerates molecular dynamics in the liquid phase and raises <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> according to the typical dependence <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> ∼ <i>M</i><sup>α</sup>. This behavior arises from nearly identical conformational transformations in these compounds, where comparable energy barriers and intramolecular dynamics render molar mass the primary determinant of structural relaxation times. In contrast, similar increase in molar mass achieved by elongating the flexible substituent lowers the <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> value and enhances both the intra- and intermolecular dynamics, underscoring internal molecular flexibility and conformational diversity as a crucial factor controlling the glass transition and near-glass-transition phenomena. Our findings, supported by differential scanning calorimetry, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, indicate internal plasticization as a fundamental mechanism shaping the properties of molecular glass-formers.",

AMF inoculation increased five organic acid contents (glutaric acid, 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid, gallic acid, 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and fumaric acid) and phosphatase activity synthesized by alfalfa and secreted by the roots and hyphae, which activated soil Ca<sub>2</sub>-P, Fe-P, and organic P, promoting root growth for P absorption and biomass. Without AMF inoculation, plant biomass, P accumulation, and root growth increased with increasing P application, and organic acid contents were higher at P20 and P40 (20 and 40 mg P kg<sup>-1</sup> dry soil).",

Within the UK, minimal work has explored SMA's experience of navigating their sexuality and experiences of adversity and resilience. A constructivist grounded theory approach was adopted. Data were gathered in 2021, from 17 semi-structured interviews with a gender diverse sample aged 16-25. The Dynamic Identity Formation Sexual Minority (DIFS) theory was generated via analysis of participant narrative and informed by existing sociopsychological models (e.g. ecological systems theory). DIFS is a sociopsychological theory, with three tiers (cultures, enactment and experience). The cultures of heteronormativity and gender binarism, and the culture of queerness sit atop. Each culture is enacted by behaviors, i.e. othering and suppression. The final tier is individual experience, which can include internalized homonegativity and/or developing a commitment to supporting others. DIFS helps understand the discrete and interacting influence of sociological structures, interpersonal relationships and psychological experiences over developmental time. Thus, a more holistic and targeted intervention approach can be utilized by psychotherapists with this group. Extra inclusivity efforts towards non-heterosexual relationships are likely to be effective in variant settings, e.g. the education system.",

A two-part generalized linear regression-based moderation analysis showed evidence of a significant exacerbating role of alcohol use severity in the relationship between negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals and the magnitude, but not likelihood, of enacting both SO and GI microaggressions. The positive association between negative attitude and the magnitude of microaggression perpetration became stronger as the severity of alcohol use increased.",

      "content": "Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) presents a major clinical burden, impacting both survival and quality of life in patients with malignancy. While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are recommended for initial treatment, decisions surrounding extended anticoagulation beyond six months remain complex due to variable recurrence and bleeding risks. This comprehensive review explores contemporary strategies for long-term CAT management, focusing on risk stratification, guideline evolution, and individualized patient-centered care. We highlight the importance of cancer type, disease status, and patient comorbidities-such as renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia-in guiding therapy duration. Recent studies suggest that reduced-dose DOAC regimens, particularly apixaban, may offer favorable safety profiles without compromising efficacy, offering a potential shift in secondary prevention paradigms. Nonetheless, bleeding risks remain significant, and validated tools for predicting long-term VTE recurrence or hemorrhagic complications are lacking.",

This systematic review evaluates factors associated with patient outcome. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases was conducted in August 2024. Data was extracted for patients with skull base osteoradionecrosis caused by nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Results were presented by narrative synthesis or with statistical analysis. 359 patients from 31 papers were included. The clivus and posterior nasopharyngeal wall were the most common subsites for osteoradionecrosis. We categorized subsites into posterior, roof and lateral areas. Subsite was not associated with ICA exposure or infection. Frequent symptoms include headache, foul odour and epistaxis. Foul odour was negatively associated with infection and epistaxis was highly associated with ICA exposure. The most common direct complication was CSF leak (18.2%), whereas the most common post-treatment complication was infection (43.8%). Carotid blowout was the most common cause of mortality (45.9%). Foul odour and epistaxis may predict cases of skull base osteoradionecrosis complicated by ICA exposure and infection. Further research is necessary to assess the significance of ORN subsite as a prognosticator or guide to treatment.",

SF contributes to structural integrity and mechanical strength through the formation of crystalline β-sheet domains, while GelMA provides a photo-cross-linkable functionality, facilitating precise modulation of mechanical and structural properties beneficial for cell support. Various cross-linking strategies, including physical (ionic, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and crystalline formation) and chemical (covalent cross-linking, photo-cross-linking, and enzymatic), are explored to optimize SF/GelMA hydrogels for enhanced tissue adhesion and tissue (skin, muscle, cartilage, bone, tendon, and ligament) regeneration applications. Furthermore, we address the current key translational challenges such as long-term biostability, large-scale production, and immune-regulatory pathways for successful clinical implementation for applications in regenerative medicine, including tissue repair and tissue reconstruction.",
