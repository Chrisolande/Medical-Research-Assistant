Although acute exercise supports neurocognitive function, its effects vary by exercise and individual characteristics. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of isometric resistance exercise (IRE) and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on prefrontal cortex oxygenation and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women and examined the influence of VMS and CRF on these outcomes.",

      "content": "A cross-over randomized controlled trial was conducted among 29 women aged 55 ± 3 years. The HIIE session included two sets of 12 × 15 s at 100% maximal aerobic power, and the IRE session included 4 × 2 min at 30% maximal voluntary force. Cognitive functions were evaluated before and after sessions using the MEM-III story recall test (episodic memory), Stroop task (inhibitory control) and n-back task (working memory). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was assessed by measuring oxyhaemoglobin (ΔHbO<sub>2</sub>), deoxygenated haemoglobin (ΔHHb) and total haemoglobin (ΔtHb) concentrations before, during and after each session. No effect of exercise was noted on cognitive performance. However, prefrontal cortex oxygenation increased during HIIE (ΔHbO<sub>2</sub>: d = 0.99, p < 0.0001; ΔHHb: d = 0.68, p = 0.018; ΔtHb: d = 0.96, p = 0.001), during IRE (ΔHbO<sub>2</sub>: d = 1.2, p = 0.003) and post-HIIE (ΔHbO<sub>2</sub> and ΔtHb: d > 1; p < 0.0001) versus control. CRF positively modulated cognitive and cerebrovascular responses to IRE, whereas VMS showed no influence. IRE and HIIE did not improve cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, but increased prefrontal cortex oxygenation, with sustained effects after HIIE. CRF positively modulated responses, whereas VMS did not, underscoring the importance of maintaining high CRF to support brain health in this population.",

      "content": "The period leading up to congenital heart surgery (CHS) consultation presents a potentially heightened timepoint for MHCs. This study aims to evaluate MHC prevalence among caregivers at the time of CHS consultation. This single-center retrospective review analyzed CHS consultations from 1/1/2019 to 10/31/2022. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was administered to caregivers attending CHS consultations. DASS-21 subscale scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were categorized as \"no concerns\" vs. \"any concerns.\" Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. A total of 373 caregiver DASS-21 assessments were identified. The median patient age was 45.6 months [IQR: 7.0-129.0], with 160 (42.8%) female and 219 (58.7%) covered by private insurance. Clinically, 47 (12.6%) patients had single-ventricle (SV) diagnoses, and 191 (51.2%) had a syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. MHC prevalence was notable among caregivers: 17.4% for depression, 29.2% for anxiety, and 34.9% for stress. Caregivers of uninsured children and those of patients with SV diagnoses had elevated odds of MHCs, especially in stress (OR 7.77;CI 1.60-37.58, p = 0.010). Higher number of previous surgeries in SV also correlated with increased caregiver stress (OR 1.35; CI 1.07-1.70, p = 0.010). MHCs are common in caregivers at CHS consultation and are associated with both clinical and sociodemographic factors. Early identification of caregiver MHCs at CHS consultation may provide an opportunity for timely intervention and support prior to surgery.",

One method for measuring the degree of PBA is the Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS), a seven-item questionnaire validated for quantifying symptoms and supporting PBA diagnoses in ALS and MS. The aim of this study was to provide a Danish translation of the CNS-LS inspired by international guidelines on cross-cultural translation and adaptation of self-report measurements. Through a six-step process, the CNS-LS was translated and back-translated by four certified translators, followed by an expert committee examination. The translation was then field-tested by interviewing patients with ALS and MS after they had completed the CNS-LS. If at least 20% of participants found an item \"unclear\", it would be reevaluated. Twelve patients with ALS patients and 30 patients with MS were tested and interviewed. None of the questionnaire items exceeded the 20% threshold for lack of clarity. We present a Danish translation of the CNS-LS to facilitate better diagnosis and quantification of PBA symptoms in Danish patients with ALS or MS. This study received funding from the PhD fellowship grant of Neuroscience Academy Denmark.",

A population-based retrospective study with a case-control design was conducted. Cases were 124 ONH/SOD patients (mean age: 13 years, SD: 7.2 years), matched to 620 unrelated population-based controls (mean age: 12.4 years, SD: 7.2 years) on area of residence, year of birth, and sex. Non-parametric statistics were used to test for differences between cases and controls on number of hospital admissions, crude rates of admissions, and LOS. Relative rates (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Primary (most responsible) diagnoses were described for hospitalisations. ONH/SOD cases had the highest percentage of hospitalisations (26.6%-32.3%) in comparison to the control group (10.2%-12.6%), especially in the SOD subgroup with hypopituitarism (42.9%-54.3%) who were also at risk of multiple hospitalisations. ONH/SOD cases had a significantly higher crude hospitalisation rate in comparison to the control group (RR range:2.3-2.8, 95% CI range:1.6-4.2), and was highest in infants < 1-year-old and in the SOD subgroup with hypopituitarism. The median LOS was significantly higher in ONH/SOD cases in comparison to the controls [median (interquartile range):7-8 (3-21) versus 3-4 (2-9) days respectively, p ≤ 0.004]. Diseases of the respiratory system were the primary reasons for hospitalisation in all groups, but they were highest in the ONH/SOD group accounting for 25.3% of their hospitalisations versus 9.5% in the unrelated controls. Children with ONH/SOD have a higher rate of hospitalisation and LOS in comparison to controls, especially in the SOD subgroup with hypopituitarism. Diseases of the respiratory system were primarily responsible for hospitalisations in all groups, but disproportionately affected the ONH/SOD group.",

Two abdominal radiologists reviewed arterial phase images and graded motion artifacts using a validated 5-point scale; grades 4 and 5 were classified as TSM. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of TSM. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age and body mass index (BMI). TSM artifacts were observed in 43 of 836 studies (5.14%). In multivariable analysis, older age (> 65 years) (adjusted OR 4.59; 95% CI 1.268-16.710; p = 0.021) and lower serum albumin (adjusted OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.143-0.761; p = 0.009) were independent predictors of TSM. Subgroup analyses demonstrated higher TSM incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 years (7.07% vs. 3.41%; p = 0.019) and in those with BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (11.11% vs. 4.73%; p = 0.052). Other variables, including sex, comorbidities, liver disease etiology, and fluid overload, were not significantly associated with TSM. TSM during gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI occurs in approximately 5% of patients and is independently associated with older age and lower serum albumin. Awareness of these risk factors can guide protocol optimization and personalized imaging strategies to improve arterial phase image quality.",

Common special methods used (when warranted) for nonclinical studies include Fluoro-Jade or silver stains for detecting neuronal death, Luxol fast blue (LFB) for examining myelin, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to demonstrate reactive astrocytes, and anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) to highlight reactive microglia and macrophages, though alternatives methods were described. The last presentation discussed artificial intelligence as an aid in detecting subtle toxicant-induced lesions during digital pathology analyses (using the Olney lesion [acute neuronal vacuolation and necrosis in the cerebral cortex] as an example). Taken together, talks in this session provided a cohesive overview of traditional and innovative approaches to facilitate microscopic evaluation for potential neurotoxicity in nonclinical studies.",

Microorganisms were <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. (n=6), <i>Gemella</i> spp. (n=2), <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (n=1), <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (n=1). Aneurysms were saccular (n=9), fusiform (n=1). Five SMAAs were partially thrombosed. Three patients presented acute abdominal pain, associated with partial thrombosis. Three became symptomatic: SMAA growth (n=2) and delayed aneurysm, enlargement, rupture, and bowel ischemia (n=1). Four were small (<25 mm), 6 were large (25-70 mm), mostly distally located (6/10). Five (3 small, 2 large) regressed under antibiotic therapy alone, 2 (25 and 40 mm) underwent coil embolization. Three underwent surgery (30, 50, and 60 mm), because of large aneurysm at SMA origin, rapid enlargement and rupture, and bowel ischemia. The outcome was favorable (mean follow-up: 43.5 months; range: 9-72). Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, occurring in a patient with a current or recent history of IE should be carefully evaluated by CTA. Symptomatic, growing aneurysms and fusiform aneurysms mainly underwent an operative repair. Five silent aneurysms (<20 mm, n=2; >20 mm, n=3) were safely monitored under antibiotic therapy, enhancing the need to further have cross-sectional imaging of the visceral circulation in all cases of left-sided IE to detect asymptomatic aneurysms. SMAAs can regress, thus conservative management of small asymptomatic ones is possible. Clinical ImpactIn our series of superior mesenteric artery infectious aneurysms (SMAA) in infective endocarditis (IE) patients (incidence: 2.1%), symptomatic, growing aneurysms and fusiform aneurysms mainly underwent an operative repair. Five silent aneurysms (<20mm, n=2; >20mm, n=3) were safely monitored under antibiotic therapy. Our study showed first, the need to have cross-sectional imaging of the visceral circulation in all cases of left sided infective endocarditis. Obviously, abdominal CT-angiography monitoring is also a cornerstone of the efficacy of the antibiotic regimen. Second, SMAAs in IE patients can regress: thus conservative management of small asymptomatic ones is possible.",

      "content": "Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor, PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration.",

      "content": "While HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2D (HSFA2D) has been shown to regulate tiller angle via LAZY1 (LA1)-mediated auxin distribution, the precise mechanisms governing this pathway remain elusive. We identified and characterized LA6, which encodes a heat shock protein 70-interacting protein, through mutant screening and the MutMap strategy. Biochemical, molecular, and genetic studies were used to elucidate the functional relationship of LA6 with HSFA2D and LA1 in mediating shoot gravitropism and tiller angle. The la6 mutant exhibited impaired shoot gravitropism and increased tiller angle due to reduced lateral auxin transport and disrupted asymmetric auxin distribution. The LA6 gene was highly expressed in shoot bases, and the LA6 protein was localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. Intriguingly, LA6 physically interacted with HSFA2D and LA1. Genetic analyses showed that LA6 acts downstream of HSFA2D and upstream of LA1 within the same regulatory pathway. Our findings reveal that the HSFA2D-LA6-LA1 module orchestrates shoot gravitropism and tiller angle in rice, which not only advances our understanding of plant architecture regulation but also provides potential targets for yield improvement.",

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 586 outpatients with ADPKD who visited the Kidney Centre at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital between July 2003 and July 2019. After excluding 67 patients, 519 were included in the final analysis. The associations of IA with sex, age, hypertension, family history of IA/subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages, and kidney volume were examined. Significant sex differences were found in patients with IA. Women had a higher distribution of anterior circulation IAs, including middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms (62.7% vs. 44.8%), and experienced SAH at an older age (46 vs. 37.5 years) than men. In sex-specific analyses, CKD stages IV-V and family history of IA/SAH were associated with IA in men and women; however, hypertension was associated with IA only in women. When IAs were cross-classified by sex and age (≥50 years), significant differences were observed, particularly in the MCA, where women aged ≥ 50 years had a higher distribution than men (40.5% vs. 5.9%, odds ratio [OR]=10.88). These location-specific differences were not observed in patients aged < 50 years. Analyses of ageing effects in patients with ADPKD revealed that compared to men, women aged ≥ 50 years had a higher risk of hypertension (OR = 4.11) and MCA aneurysms (OR = 5.93) than those aged < 50 years. MCA aneurysms in women aged ≥ 50 years were associated with hypertension (OR = 8.27). Sex and age significantly affect IA development in patients with ADPKD, highlighting the significance of hypertension in older women at risk of MCA aneurysms.",

Data collection involved facilitated workshops (building on Phase 1), followed by feedback and optimisation sessions. Participants included service providers (doctors, nurses, allied health and medical record staff), adolescents, and caregivers with lived experience of providing or receiving outpatient care at a tertiary paediatric hospital in Australia. Five co-design workshops, nine feedback, and two optimisation sessions were conducted with nine service providers, two adolescents, and three caregivers. Co-design participants created resources to introduce EQ-5D-Y-5L as a 'general health tracking questionnaire' and explain its purpose. EQ-5D-Y-5L responses were designed to be displayed by item. A display of results over time was also designed. A patient empowerment approach was taken with regards to flagging specific EQ-5D-Y-5L items for discussion with clinicians, whereby patients or caregivers control which items are flagged. To ensure clinical review and action of EQ-5D-Y-5L responses, resources, including clinician training, clinician decision support tool, and matching patient booklet and resource pathway, were co-designed. Combined, these design elements make up the P-PROM ROCK Program. Consumer engagement produced important insights that would've otherwise been missed, ensuring the P-PROM ROCK Program empowers patients. For generic P-PROMs to meaningfully impact patient-clinician visits, supports and resources are required to ensure clinical review and action.",

      "content": "The data of 139 PTC patients with ultrasonically suspected cervical lymph node metastasis treated in our hospital from December 2022 to November 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. All included patients underwent ultrasound examination of cervical lymph nodes, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNA-C) examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration eluent thyroglobulin (FNA-Tg). Typical ultrasound signs for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis (US-M) and ultrasound-guided FNA-Tg for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis were compared and analyzed. Results indicate that 71 patients were diagnosed with cervical lymph node metastasis through surgery and subsequently included in the metastatic group; the remaining 68 patients were included in the nonmetastatic group. The FNA-Tg value in the metastatic group was higher than that in the nonmetastatic group; the difference was significant (p < 0.001). The AUC values for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis in PTC patients using US-M, FNA-Tg, and US-M+FNA-Tg were 0.854, 0.927, and 0.952. When the cut-off value of FNA-Tg was 229.1 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis in PTC patients were 84.5% and 89.5%. Ultrasound-guided FNA-Tg level is closely related to cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC. The combination of ultrasound examination and FNA-Tg testing significantly enhances the accuracy of predicting lateral cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC.",

However, targeted tissue repair requires a specific shape and biological function design, and most natural-protein-based hydrogel scaffolds are predominantly confined to specific tissue repair applications. Here, we developed a versatile structural biomimetic natural protein platform through synergistic electrospinning, photopolymerization, and metal-coordination strategies. By integrating methacrylated silk fibroin (SFMA) with acrylated bisphosphonates (AcBP), we developed a dynamically functionalizable matrix that enables (1) customizable shape control via tunable electrospinning collectors and (2) on-demand biological function customization through metal-ion chelation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this platform's scenario-specific therapeutic efficacy: (i) Mg<sup>2+</sup>-functionalized membranes (S-LB-Mg) that orchestrate angiogenic-osteogenic coupling in critical-sized calvarial defects, (ii) Ag<sup>+</sup>-integrated dressing (S-LB-Ag) enabling bacterial eradication via a nonantibiotic mechanism and accelerating infected wound closure, and (iii) Zn<sup>2+</sup>-loaded conduits (S-LB-Zn) that drive macrophage M2 polarization to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration.",

      "content": "Endosymbionts are widespread in animals and they have deeply shaped their hosts' evolution and ecology. As they are usually maternally-inherited from one host generation to the next, a diverse array of endosymbionts (including bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes and viruses) have evolved strategies to distort host sex ratios towards females in arthropods, via male killing, parthenogenesis induction and feminization. Seminal discoveries made in the past few years have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of sex ratio distortion in various host-symbiont systems. Emerging trends suggest that: (i) a single symbiont gene is generally sufficient to mediate sex ratio distortion in a given system, (ii) causal genes are often associated with mobile elements, including prophages and plasmids, (iii) causal genes are evolutionarily diverse between systems, although they may exhibit homologous domains, and (iv) host sex-specific molecular pathways, such as sex determination and dosage compensation, are preferential targets of cytoplasmic symbiont factors. It appears that the various reproductive manipulations have evolved multiple times independently, suggesting that the recently elucidated host-symbiont systems only represent the tip of the iceberg of the high diversity of sex ratio distortion mechanisms.",

Under optimized conditions, the method demonstrated detection limits between 0.1 and 0.25 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for the target analytes.

Secondary analysis of prospectively collected clinical trial data of 382 patients with HM.

Spleen diameter and volume predictive performance for clinical response investigated using random forest model. [Formula: see text] describes the relationship between spleen diameter and volume. [Formula: see text] for splenomegaly was 546 cm³. [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for assessing response resulting in highest agreement with Lugano criteria were 570 cm<sup>3</sup>, 73%, and 170 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Predictive performance for response between diameter and volume were not significantly different (P=0.78). This study provides empirical spleen volume threshold and percentual changes that best correlate with diameter thresholds, i.e., Lugano criteria, for assessment of response to treatment in patients with HM. In our dataset use of spleen volumetric thresholds versus diameter thresholds resulted in similar response assessment categories and did not signal differences in predictive values for response.",

Pregnant PLWH were excluded. The primary outcome was absolute weight change from index visit date to 6 and 12 months. A total of 200 patients were included (n = 45 in Group 1, n = 26 in Group 2, and n = 129 in Group 3). Groups 1 and 2 experienced a median weight increase of 0.9 kg and 0.5 kg, respectively, from index to 12 months, while Group 3 experienced a median weight decrease of 1.1 kg from index to 12 months. Body mass index (BMI) increased from index to 12 months by a median of 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, and decreased by a median of 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Group 3. Hemoglobin A1c increased by a median of 0.1% in Groups 1 and 2 with no change in Group 3. Using mixed linear models adjusted for sex, age, and baseline BMI, there were no significant changes in adjusted mean weight, A1c, and LDL across the groups from index to 6 and 12 months. In Group 3, patients at the upper quartile of age were observed to experience a significant BMI decrease from index to 12 months (p = 0.008). Switching to BIC- or DTG-based regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic was not associated with weight gain in treatment-experienced, virologically-suppressed PLWH in this single-center study. The study findings may reassure clinicians who are hesitant about switching treatment-experienced patients to newer BIC- or DTG-containing regimens due to concerns about potential weight gain.",

Various models were tested on data of patients from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC). Data preprocessing involves structuring and handling missing values. Six predictive models, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), linear regression (LR), decision tree, and random forest (RF), were employed in predicting optimal warfarin dosage. The best dose for each patient will be predicted using one of the six regression models. This comparative study showed that the mean (and the standard deviation) of warfarin dose for diabetic and non-diabetic patients were 38.73 (15.37) and 34.50 (18.27) mg per week, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of various statin they use is considered and patient undergoing atorvastatin and rosuvastatin therapy against the necessity of high dose warfarin if the diabetic patients use lovastatin and fluvastatin. Diabetic patients under statin therapy, considering the specific statin used, require different warfarin dose. Through the application of advanced machine learning, models as dosing predictors may attenuate the adverse effects of warfarin.",

In order to better understand hydrogen bonding interactions, both analyses were employed. The NIR spectroscopic analysis shows the presence of various types of hydrogen-bonded clusters in the structure of glycerol and a strong hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of the imidazole ring and the oxygen of ethylsulfate anions. In the binary mixtures, hydrogen-bonded clusters of glycerol were sustained upon addition of [C<sub>2</sub>mim]C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> up to a mole fraction of 0.6. Further addition of [C<sub>2</sub>mim]C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> causes breakdown of the cluster of glycerol and forms solvated ions of [C<sub>2</sub>mim]C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>4.</sub> The variation of excess molar volume, dynamic viscosity deviation, excess molar Gibbs free energy of activation, and thermodynamic activation parameters also show transitions at this particular composition. Hence, the dynamic interaction between the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonds in these compounds controls the thermodynamic properties, which is the key factor to apply this binary system in various fields.",

This study evaluated the effects of TE biopsy on β-hCG dynamics. Serum β-hCG levels on days 9 and 11 post-blastocyst transfer were compared between PGT and non-PGT cycles. Additionally, β-hCG thresholds were explored as potential prognostic markers for success in assisted reproductive technology (ART). This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Memorial Şişli Hospital, İstanbul, Türkiye, between January 2012 and January 2021. The patients undergoing frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfer were divided into PGT (1698 cycles) and non-PGT (1830 cycles) groups. The serum β-hCG levels on days 9 and 11 after embryo transfer (ET) and the rate of β-hCG increase were compared. In both groups, higher baseline β-hCG levels and rates of increase were correlated with live birth outcomes than with clinical or biochemical pregnancy loss (p < 0.001). PGT cycles showed lower baseline β-hCG levels across all pregnancy outcomes, but no significant difference in β-hCG increase rates (p > 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, PGT cycles were not found to be significantly associated with β-hCG levels. Serum β-hCG dynamics strongly predict live birth and clinical pregnancy. PGT did not significantly affect β-hCG levels after adjustment for confounders.",

      "content": "Placental ageing refers to the physiological accumulation of a senescent phenotype over a healthy pregnancy. In pregnancies affected by complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, placental ageing is notably accelerated and observed at an earlier gestational age. Metformin is used during pregnancy for an increasing variety of indications, including treatment of gestational diabetes, and may have a role in slowing cellular ageing. It is therefore essential to understand the potential impact of metformin on placental ageing. Placental samples (n = 105) were obtained from women with body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and who were randomized to treatment with metformin or placebo during pregnancy. Ageing was assessed by measuring telomere length, histological examination, and using array-based technologies to investigate gene expression and methylation. Results were validated using isolated human trophoblasts treated in vitro with metformin, and in a complementary mouse model. There were no differences between metformin-exposed and control placentas in terms of telomere length, fibrosis or calcification. There were no differences in placental gene expression or methylation patterns by metformin status. In our mouse model, no genes classically associated with cellular ageing were differentially expressed and no senescence pathway showed evidence of enrichment with metformin treatment. There was no evidence that metformin either slows or accelerates placental ageing pathways in the complementary models that we investigated. Our findings are reassuring with regard to the safety of metformin used to treat gestational diabetes, but do not support a role for metformin in the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes in non-diabetic women. KEY POINTS: Accelerated placental ageing, where the senescent phenotype that normally accumulates over a healthy pregnancy is observed at a premature gestational age, is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

      "content": "Metformin has been proposed as an anti-ageing drug elsewhere. Therefore, metformin could alter the trajectory of placental ageing and prevent associated pregnancy complications. The present study incorporated human data from a randomized clinical trial and complementary models. Metformin did not impact methylation-predicted gestational age, telomere length, gene expression or histological ageing in human placentas treated in vivo, isolated trophoblasts treated in vitro or mouse models. Metformin neither decelerated nor accelerated placental ageing, thereby supporting its continued use in the obstetric setting, for instance in the treatment of gestational diabetes. Metformin cannot be recommended to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes because we found no evidence suggesting it decelerates placental ageing. Further research is warranted to find drug therapies for this purpose.",

      "content": "Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis frequently requires surgical intervention when conservative treatments fail. Minimally invasive techniques such as unilateral laminectomy for bilateral decompression have largely replaced traditional open laminectomy because of effective decompression and reduced tissue damage. This study compared the radiological and clinical outcomes of tubular decompression and unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) in patients with severe stenosis. This was a retrospective, monocentric, nonrandomized study including 103 patients with severe lumbar spinal stenosis (52 tubular decompression, 51 UBE) from July 2020 to April 2024. The primary radiological outcomes were changes in anteroposterior diameter and dural sac surface area, assessed by MRI. Clinical outcomes included operative time, complication rates, and patient-reported outcomes with the Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale for pain, evaluated preopertatively, 3 and 12 months postoperatively. As compared with tubular decompression, UBE resulted in a more significant increase in anteroposterior diameter (+ 4.9 vs. + 3.75 mm, p < 0.001) and dural sac surface area (+ 95.8 vs. + 85.4 mm², p = 0.038). However, with both techniques, clinical improvements were similar at 3 and 12 months, with no significant difference in Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale score, or patient satisfaction. The complication rate, including reoperation, was low in both groups, but the incidence of symptomatic hematoma was higher with UBE than tubular decompression. Both tubular decompression and UBE were effective for spinal stenosis treatment, with UBE providing superior radiological decompression, even in the early learning phase. However, the techniques were comparable in clinical outcomes at 3 months and 1 year.",

The liposomes, prepared by the traditional lipid thin-film extrusion method, were characterized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) and MADLS, showing high monodispersity and long-term stability. These model samples allowed us to evaluate the effect of key variables on the performance of AF4 coupled to in-flow dynamic light scattering, identifying the influence of sample concentration on analytical bias for size determination. We extended the analysis to other types of particles (<i>i.e.</i> polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate), which are relevant for environmental and drug delivery applications. Our results demonstrate that the analytical bias for in-flow DLS measurements follows a universal law, nearly independent of the chemical nature of the nanoparticles investigated. Subsequently, we combined MADLS and AF4 techniques, exploiting a programmable fraction collection system, enabling the accurate determination of particle size and number concentration in the absence of flow, and providing higher resolution for the size distributions. Our approach could be extended to any kind of colloid suitable for light scattering methods and paves the way for the revisitation of AF4-DLS instrumentation that may become widely available in the future, expanding the set of analytical tools for nanomedicine applications.",

      "content": "In aCGH, HF DNA was used as control, while test DNA was from the other breeds. Each pooled test DNA sample was a representative of 18 animals belonging to three distinct geographical locations of India. The study using Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) of Agilent Genomic Workbench revealed the highest number of duplications in KNG (1189 genes), followed by TP (534 genes), and the greatest number of deletions in SW (774 genes). Among these genes, 183 and 76 innate immune genes with hub genes TGF-β1, CD79A, and IL4 showed duplications in KNG and TP, respectively. In SW, 113 innate immune genes with hub genes PSMC5, MAPK1, and AXIN1 showed deletions. In contrast, KF and HF showed no genes with deletions and fewer duplicated innate immunity genes, reflecting either lower genetic variability in their immune gene repertoire or a potential bias due to HF DNA as a control in aCGH. Functional enrichment of innate immune genes revealed duplications in KNG enriched in interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) activity (p = 9.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and nucleobase metabolism (p = 2.88 × 10⁻<sup>11</sup>), while duplications in TP were linked to DNA-binding transcription factor activity (p = 2.34 × 10⁻<sup>14</sup>). The KEGG pathway analysis highlighted Th17 cell differentiation (p = 1.3 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>) in KNG and Hippo signalling (p = 3.7 × 10<sup>-2</sup>) in TP. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of genetic diversity in shaping innate immunity in indigenous Indian cattle breeds, favouring a balanced crossbreeding to sustain the Indian dairy sector.",

      "content": "Physical exercise (PE) protects against AD, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize that PE-mediated upregulation of REV-ERBα and TFEB pathways mitigates AD-related dysfunctions. Acute effects of FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, were assessed as a TFEB suppressor in mice subjected to aerobic exercise. Chronic treadmill training (8 weeks, 4 sessions/week) was performed in APP/PS1 mice to evaluate hippocampal adaptations through functional tests, imaging, and molecular analyses. Acute FK506 administration inhibited Ppp3ca and Ppp3r1 expression without altering Tfeb levels. Chronic PE improved aerobic capacity, strength, coordination, and memory, promoted neuronal survival, and decreased Aβ levels in APP mice. It also elevated REV-ERBα protein and Nr1 d1 expression in wild-type and APP mice, increased ALP activity, and reduced abnormal mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP mice. A positive correlation between REV-ERBα and Nr1 d1 levels was observed in the 2-min NOR test. Public RNA-seq data revealed lower NR1D1 mRNA in extracellular vesicles from the human frontal cortex of AD patients compared to controls. PE prevents cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice, enhancing memory, physical performance, and hippocampal health. These benefits are associated with ALP activation, mitochondrial improvements, and reduced neuroinflammation. REV-ERBα may mediate these protective effects, but further studies using pharmacological and genetic models are needed to confirm its role.",

Are pre-service teachers' (RQ3) knowledge of ADHD, (RQ4) stress, and (RQ5) mindfulness skills associated with three types of responses to working with students with ADHD: evaluation of social/behavioral problems, emotional distress, and investment in treatment and classroom practices? (RQ6) Does mindfulness moderate the association between stress and teachers' responses to students with ADHD? Participants were 101 education majors in a teacher education program at a large Southeastern university in the United States. Multivariate regressions were employed to assess RQs 3-6. Pre-service teachers correctly answered 52% of items (<i>SD</i> = 0.15) measuring knowledge of ADHD. There were no significant associations between knowledge of ADHD, stress, and mindfulness skills and pre-service teachers' responses to students with ADHD, nor did mindfulness moderate the association between stress and outcomes. However, pre-service teachers with previous experience teaching students with ADHD perceived students' behavioral challenges as more serious than those without experience. Results indicated that pre-service teachers lacked comprehensive knowledge of ADHD but responded to students with ADHD in a supportive manner. Notably, these findings indicate that teachers entering the workforce within the next two years are willing to implement supportive practices for students with ADHD. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

Histological evaluation of the wound site was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson trichrome staining. Molecular analysis showed that the 5% black fig leaf cream exhibited significantly higher anti-inflammatory activity than the control groups. Histopathological examination revealed increased collagen production, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization, along with reduced inflammatory cell density and bleeding compared to controls.

Supportive technologies, such as functional electrical stimulation cycling (FES-cycling), are increasingly recognized as a tool with the potential to improve physical exercise in patients constrained to bed rest. In this randomized clinical trial, patients admitted to a high-complexity ward exhibiting clinical signs of muscle weakness (e.g., report of loss of strength, gait, or balance deficit due to weakness or restriction to bed) were enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated to a recumbent high-intensity, low-volume FES-cycling exercise or a control group. The primary outcomes measured were torque, power output, stimulation cost (neuromuscular efficiency), and ambulation capacity. The analysis included 16 patients (eight in each group). Postintervention, the FES-cycling group presented a greater increase in both absolute (4.25 ± 3.15 vs. 0.04 ± 3.49 Nm, p = 0.02) and percentage torque (117 ± 88 vs. 8% ± 53%, p < 0.01) compared to the control.

The main predictor variable for this study was women's empowerment and the outcome variable was healthcare utilization for childhood illnesses. The data source for the study was the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey dataset. Complex sample ordinal regression analysis was employed, controlling for confounders. Adjusted cumulative odds ratios (cuORs) and 95% confidence intervals were computed to estimate effect size. A total of 2101 (weighted) cases of children <5 y of age were included in this study. Children whose mothers were empowered with a wife-beating attitude were 59% more likely to get healthcare for all illnesses in children <5 y of age (β=0.46, cuOR 1.59, p<0.01). Children whose mothers had no problems with healthcare access were also more likely to receive health services for all illnesses in children <5 y of age (β=0.42, cuOR 1.52, p=0.01).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of high altitude on orexin expression and its pathophysiological mechanisms involved in high altitude stroke injury. In this study, changes of orexin expression were observed by simulating hypoxia at different altitudes, and the changes of orexin and its receptor were analysed by constructing a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model after high altitude simulation. Finally, the protective effect of orexin on cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury was evaluated by exogenous orexin intervention. The results indicated that at an altitude of 4000 m, orexin expression was increased, but then decreased at higher altitudes. Rats exposed to 4000 m hypoxia simulation and MCAO exhibited increased orexin and type 1 receptor expression. Exogenous orexin A administration reduced infarct size, improved microcirculation blood flow in the ischaemic cortex, accelerated blood flow, elevated blood oxygen saturation and mitigated systemic oxidative stress and inflammation.",

(2) To assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using COPD assessment test (CAT) scores, intake of rescue medications, and frequency of exacerbations. In this prospective observational comparative study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two sequences: sequence 1 (n = 50) receiving IND/GLY (110/50 μg) once daily and sequence 2 (n = 50) receiving TRP/FOR (9/12 μg) twice daily. The evaluation of postinhalation FEV1 at 1 h after treatment was conducted on days 28, 56, and 84. Patients in the IND/GLY sequence showed significantly higher FEV1, 1 h postinhalation than those in TRP/FOR. A higher proportion of the patients stated that they were very satisfied with IND/GLY versus TRP/FOR about dyspnea reduction and showed a significant improvement in CAT score. IND/GLY demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile. This study indicated that, beyond FEV1, important PROs as well as lung function improved with the use of long-acting IND/GLY combination when compared with TRP/FOR.",

      "content": "A GSP delivery system based on water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion technology was innovatively developed, aiming at solving the difficult problem of the limited application of GSPs in high-fat cookie systems. In this study, we explored the potential application of GSPs in functional cookie products by constructing a GSP-tea seed oil stabilized emulsion system. Emulsion systems prepared by high-speed shear emulsification demonstrate superior performance (water-oil ratio of 2:8, polyglyceryl ricinoleate concentration of 50 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, sucrose concentration of 30 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, with 0.1% GSP added). The emulsion had an emulsification index of <1%, a zeta potential of 44.2 ± 0.5 mV and remained stable for many days after storage at 4 °C. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that the emulsion possessed a typical W/O structure, and GSP improved the thermal stability of the emulsion by 0.8 °C through the formation of a three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network, achieving a DPPH radical scavenging rate of 99.63%. After application in biscuit products, the shelf-life was extended by 37.32%, and the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) decreased to 41.17%. We successfully constructed a GSP-enhanced functional emulsion system and elucidated its mechanism of action in improving product quality through a dual mechanism of amylase inhibition and antioxidant activity. This technology provides a new solution for developing healthy bakery products, although its industrial application still requires further work to address stability issues under extreme conditions. The findings of this study offer important guidance for applying plant polyphenols in food colloidal systems. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Together with the discovery of green fluorescent protein and its derivatives and the development of a vast array of fluorescent imaging probes and conjugates, it is now possible to image virtually any intracellular or extracellular protein or structure. Traditional static imaging of fixed bone cells and tissues takes a snapshot view of events at a specific time point but can often miss the dynamic aspects of the events being investigated. This chapter provides an overview of the application of live cell imaging approaches for the study of bone cells and bone organ cultures. Rather than emphasizing technical aspects of the imaging equipment, which vary considerably in different laboratories, we have focused on what we consider to be the important principles that are of most practical use for an investigator setting up these techniques in their own laboratory.",

These structural changes did not increase the propensity toward formation of amyloid fibrils, suggesting that the self-associated species are not on the pathway to amyloid fibril formation. Increasing concentration of the fatty acid-conjugated amylin analogue 1) induced self-association to an average size corresponding to a pentamer around 30 μM, 2) increased repulsion between self-associated species, and 3) increased α-helix content which leveled off around 0.25 mM. Only at significantly higher peptide concentrations (2.2 mM), amyloid fibril formation was observed following 24 h continuous exposure to extreme mechanical stress conditions. The extent of electrostatic repulsion between the self-associated species was reduced by increasing NaCl concentration (up to 50 mM) or by raising pH (from pH 3 to pH 5). However, under conditions with the least electrostatic repulsion, 4 h of continuous exposure to extreme mechanical stress was needed to induce formation of amyloid fibrils of this inherently stable molecule.",

      "content": "A risk-based approach was used to assess risks impacting the discriminative power and measurement uncertainty. design of experiments optimized medium pH, volume and rotation speed, considering two experimental batches. With Monte Carlo simulations, the Method Operable Design Region was constructed to allow batch A approval and batch B failure. Validation confirmed that the methods were selective, precise and accurate, with combined standard uncertainties of 1.7 % for INH and 3.8 % for RIF. The guard bands defined new acceptance limits in the three stages of dissolution, minimizing both consumer and producer risks. A hazard analysis and critical control point plan was established as a control strategy. If the dissolved percentage of RIF or INH leads to a batch failure, two options are possible: retesting or discarding the batch, considering guard bands to ensure a producer risk lower than 5 %. The study innovates by demonstrating the relevance of incorporating AQbD in dissolution testing, ensuring more reliable methods for controlling product quality.",

Herein, we aimed to explore the potential cost-effectiveness of a new bioprosthetic valve with RESILIA tissue versus mechanical alternatives from a Spanish healthcare perspective. Health outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), adverse events, and costs were estimated for two cohorts of patients with severe AS (aged ≥ 65 or 55-64 years) over a lifetime horizon employing a UK cost-effectiveness model adapted to Spanish clinical practice to compare a novel bioprosthesis versus mechanical alternatives. This model included a decision tree to describe short-term outcomes and a partitioned survival model to evaluate mortality and long-term outcomes.",

The novel bioprosthetic valve led to cost savings for both cohorts (€6209/patient for age ≥ 65 years; €8289/patient for ages 55-64 years). These were mainly driven by a reduction in anticoagulation- and adverse event-associated resources, outweighing the costs derived from more reoperations estimated with the novel bioprosthetic valve. An observable increase in QALYs was detected in both age groups (0.0051 and 0.0191, respectively). Hence, the novel bioprosthetic valve is expected to be a dominant alternative for patients 55 years or older who are eligible for SAVR. It remained cost-effective in > 98% of sensitivity analyses. Our exploratory study indicates the novel RESILIA bioprosthetic valve as a potential alternative to mechanical valves for SAVR in patients 55 years or older can lead to budgetary cost savings and improved health outcomes in Spain.",

This study classifies current OPG into four types based on their differential modes: voltage, frequency, optical rotation, and magnetic field differential modes. We introduce the concept of inherent common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and analyze the discrepancy between the inherent CMRR and the measured CMRR, as well as the upper limit of inherent CMRR. We point out that although the magnetic field differential method has the potential to increase the inherent CMRR by a factor of 1 + A(s)F(s), where A(s) and F(s) represent the forward and feedback channel complex gain, respectively, the often-overlooked difference between feedback gains between channels may impose a practical limit on the achievable inherent CMRR. We designed and fabricated a compact, unshielded OPG with a specially designed scheme to minimize the distance between the sensing head and the magnetic source.",

In different terrestrial ecosystems, natural regeneration showed greater effectiveness in late-stage SOC and MAC accumulation, with 72% and 61% higher in forests (> 40 years) and 64% and 63% higher in grasslands (> 20 years) compared to active restoration. In shrublands, late-stage (> 15 years) MIC accumulation was 62% higher under natural regeneration than under active restoration. In addition, natural regeneration enhanced SOC storage in deeper soil layers and in carbon-poor areas.

Moreover, elongation and secondary nucleation appeared to be competing processes, depending on the density of the monomers adsorbed at the fiber-liquid interface. Finally, bundling involves the initial association of fibers by interactions between surface-exposed groups, followed by stabilization of the bundle by surface reorganization, which allows for favorable interactions between aromatic groups.",

      "content": "It achieves long-distance wind dispersal through stem reshaping. However, the underlying ecological adaptation mechanisms of this dispersal strategy remain unexplored. Combining with field and laboratory observations, we revealed that four coordinated processes - plant phenology, cell wall development, water supplies, and aerodynamic adaptations - interactively facilitate the anemochory of this endemic species in the Eurasian steppes. Specifically, the development of the cell wall with heterogeneous microfibril arrangement plays a critical role in hygroscopic stem reshaping, which occurs in synchrony with seed maturation. Remarkably, the subsequently dry and windy season perfectly follows these two synchronized processes, providing ideal dehydration conditions for stem reshaping and enhancing aerodynamic efficiency for long-distance dispersal. This model for long-distance dispersal innovatively showcases how microscopic cell wall structure propels macroscopic dispersal capabilities and environmental adaptation, ultimately enhancing ecosystem resilience to environmental changes. Collectively, these results indicate the potential for promoting the introduction and cultivation of C. squarrosa to support the restoration of degraded and arid ecosystems. Moreover, this newly identified mechanism provides a valuable direction for future research aimed at developing herbaceous plant varieties with improved dispersal capabilities through molecular breeding techniques.",

Retrospective review of patients undergoing pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery by a single surgeon between 2016 and 2023. Patients were identified before and after the 2020 COVID pandemic as this marked a transition point where same day discharge became heavily emphasized. The historic cohort (group 1) represents patients admitted overnight with vaginal packing compared to those discharged home same day to remove their own packing (group 2). Healthcare utilization and complications were recorded in the first 30 days postoperatively. Thirty-eight patients were identified in group 1 and 39 in group 2. Age, BMI, and estimated blood loss was similar. There were 20 total unplanned encounters with 10 in each group (p = 0.95). Unplanned encounters in group 1 were seven phone calls/messages, one office visit, and two ED visits compared to three phone calls/messages, five office visits, and two ED visits in group 2. Overall complication rate was similar with six in group 1 and seven in group 2 (p = 0.80). There were zero cases of retained packing. Patients may safely be discharged home with vaginal packing in place with similar rate of complications and healthcare utilization when compared to hospital admission.",

      "content": "However, limited research has explored the cumulative effects of regular voluntary exercise on both oxidative stress and defence mechanisms in hippocampus and cortex, two regions essential for cognitive function. Especially, adaptations in the young, healthy brain are insufficiently understood. This study investigates the impact of 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running on oxidative damage and counteracting defence mechanisms in the cortex and hippocampus of young, healthy female rats. To this end, we assessed oxidative damage to proteins and DNA, antioxidant defence, and DNA repair mechanisms, focusing on the base excision repair pathway. Our findings show that 8 weeks of voluntary exercise does not significantly modify oxidative damage or antioxidant defences in either cortical or hippocampal brain regions. Instead, the voluntary wheel running intervention led to a reduction in the levels of DNA polymerase β and mitochondrial apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, key enzymes involved in base excision repair. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA copy number increased in the cortex, but decreased in the hippocampus, suggesting distinct regional adaptations. Collectively, these results indicate that the healthy young brain maintains redox homeostasis despite reduced DNA repair capacity. By analysing a comprehensive array of biomarkers in two brain regions, this study addresses gaps in our current knowledge on prolonged training and brain health and provides valuable insights into how regular exercise produces region-specific and shared responses in the healthy state.",

Differences in brain regions identified through TBSS were observed in the genu of the corpus callosum and the left anterior corona radiata (p < 0.05). Covariance analysis revealed that the BDSI + group exhibited significantly lower FA values in these regions compared to the HCs (p < 0.05). Partial correlation analyses showed that the FA values in the genu of corpus callosum were negatively correlated with BSSI scores (r = -0.592, p = 0.026) and TMT-A scores (r = -0.642, p = 0.013).

This study aimed to assess NDV outcomes at 2 years in a cohort of neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and identify perioperative variables associated with non-optimal NDV. This analysis included neonates from the Loire Infant Follow-up Team (LIFT) cohort who underwent CPB between 2014 and 2021. NDV outcomes were assessed at 24 months using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-2) and/or expert clinical evaluations. Non-optimal NDV was defined as two or more ASQ domains below cut-off values or a clinical diagnosis of neurodevelopmental delay. Of 254 neonates operated on 84 were analyzed. Non-optimal NDV was observed in 11 patients (13.1%), while 65 (77.4%) were classified as having Optimal NDV. Motor and cognitive delays were infrequent (5%), and language delays were observed in 9.5% of cases. No association between major complication during post-operative period and non-optimal NDV was found. Maximal serum lactate levels during the first 72 postoperative hours were significantly associated with non-optimal NDV after adjusting for RACHS category (adjusted odds ratio: 1.41 per mmol/L above 2.2 mmol/L, p = 0.04). Contemporary neonatal cardiac surgery shows encouraging NDV outcomes, with achieving normal development by 2 years. Elevated postoperative lactate levels, used as a surrogate of serious events occurring during the post-operative period, were associated with non-optimal NDV, highlighting the importance of optimizing perioperative care. Larger studies with extended follow-up are needed to validate these findings and explore additional modifiable predictors of long-term outcomes.",

      "content": "Measurement of the conformation of DNA in protein-DNA complexes is important to decipher the role of the DNA conformation and dynamics in protein recognition and function. In this work, we report a rigid nucleotide-independent spin label that places paramagnetic Cu(II) within the DNA helix. The labeling strategy exploits the chelation of Cu(II) to two 8-aminoquinoline moieties, one in each strand. Because the rigidity of the probe avoids potentially confounding motions of the label itself, EPR signals can resolve 2-3 Å changes in interspin distance; the breadth of the distance distribution reports dynamic fluctuations from the most probable conformation. Continuous wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) shows that Cu(II) coordinates properly to the labeling sites. Measurements of the interspin dipolar interaction on DNA oligonucleotides with two labels placed at various distances demonstrate that the label provides accurate and narrow distance distributions sensitive to DNA conformation and flexibility. Molecular dynamics simulations support these interpretations. We utilized this label to measure the conformations of DNA when the type II restriction endonuclease <i>Eco</i>RV binds to its specific recognition sequence. The results provide in-solution evidence that the <i>Eco</i>RV endonuclease induces axial DNA bending in the absence of metal ions, contrary to a long-standing belief. Furthermore, the distance distribution narrows upon protein binding and even further on subsequent metal binding, implying that bound protein constrains the bending dynamics of DNA.",

Females tended to score higher than males on behavioral aspects of grandparenthood, such as providing emotional and educational support. Black grandparents were more likely than White participants to view grandparenthood as symbolic of family continuity. All five major trait dimensions of personality were modestly associated with some perceptions of grandparenthood, with maturity-relevant traits being more associated with positive perceptions across MEG scales. Symptoms of personality disorder were also modestly associated with MEG scales. These results underscore grandparenthood is a multidimensional role viewed differently across individuals.",

Historically, Ableist ideologies led to attempts to erase disability from the social fabric (e.g., the Eugenics movement). Speechism is the prejudice and discrimination of people because their language, use of language, or mode of expression is deemed inferior. Speechism and Ableism obstruct the true reality of the experiences of people who use AAC. Ableism presumes that the abled-bodied experience is the only legitimate and valid experience and does not recognize that many disabled people experience their lives very differently. This perspective makes invisible the ableist experiences that disabled people have to face in many facets of our lives. This problem is compounded for people who use AAC who may face challenges explaining the full extent and impact of these ableist experiences. As an AAC community, we must confront Ableism in our field and industry by always prioritizing the lived experiences of people who use AAC in the development of AAC technology and policy. People who use AAC must be at the decision table regarding everything that involves us as a community.",

      "content": "Examples for constructing closed pores exist, but there is a need for a simple, cost-effective approach and a deeper understanding of the relationship between closed-pore formation and open pores in precursors. Here, we present a natural template-driven strategy using bamboo as a sustainable precursor to address these challenges. Removing natural templates during pyrolysis at 800 °C generates open pores (0.5-1.7 nm), particularly those in the 0.5-0.7 nm range, which are critical for closed-pore formation during carbonization. Accordingly, we developed an HC material with a true density (1.67 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) and a high closed-pore volume of 0.16 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The optimized HC demonstrates excellent sodium-ion storage performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 369 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and a plateau capacity of 275 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 30 mA g<sup>-1</sup>, while retaining 303 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 300 cycles at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high-voltage slope capacity arises from sodium adsorption at defect sites, whereas sodium clustering in closed pores drives the low-voltage plateau. This study offers a sustainable and scalable pathway for advancing HC anodes in sodium-ion batteries.",

Until the time of this documentation, 242 children from Gaza had been referred to Children Not Numbers for management, of which 63 (26%) required rehabilitation due to debilitating injuries and disability. The majority (60%) of those requiring rehabilitation presented with traumatic conditions and 32% presented with neurologic conditions. Average age of these children was 6.9 years (range 4 months to 17 years). Rehabilitation and continuous care and support is essential for injured and disabled children who survive the war in Gaza, to give them a better chance of achieving optimal functional outcomes and wellbeing.

      "content": "S. military branches. The survey, which remained open from January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, evaluated the training, experience, and comfort levels of respondents in providing medical direction. Statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and analysis of variance to identify significant disparities in training outcomes. The survey yielded responses from 139 EM physicians, revealing significant variability in EMS training across residency programs. Results demonstrate that physicians who had received a crash course reported consistently higher comfort levels in performing critical medical direction tasks. Specifically, these physicians reported greater proficiency in teaching medics (74.7 ± 13.6 vs. 67.9 ± 25.0, P = .0326), establishing protocols (76.9 ± 17.3 vs. 63.4 ± 27.6, P = .0079), providing QA/QI feedback (74.2 ± 17.7 vs. 66.6 ± 27.8, P = .0549), and guiding complicated resuscitations (77.3 ± 15.3 vs. 65.3 ± 28.6, P = .0087) and procedures over the radio (74.3 ± 19.4 vs. 64.2 ± 27.6, P = .0373) compared to the respondents without training outside of residency. Conversely, physicians without supplementary training and no practical exposure reported the lowest self-perceived proficiency, particularly in high-stakes LSCO scenarios. The study confirms a critical gap in the preparedness of EM physicians to serve as Medical Directors in LSCO, largely because of inconsistent EMS training during residency. These findings underscore the \"Walker Dip\" phenomenon-an observed decline in casualty survival rates when transitioning from peacetime to initial conflict phases due to inadequate medical service adaptation. The results support the need for standardized, comprehensive training programs that incorporate Tactical Combat Casualty Care principles, advanced decision-making skills, and the use of modern technology for remote medical direction. Addressing these training disparities can enhance the operational readiness and effectiveness of military medical teams. Future research should focus on developing a centralized training curriculum that aligns with the evolving demands of modern military operations and tests its efficacy in improving prehospital and battlefield medical outcomes.",

A convenience sample of 161 nurses completed the Conditions for Work Effectiveness-II Questionnaire, the MISSCARE and a single-question rating of quality of care. Correlation, T-tests, regression and ANOVA were used to analyse data. Nurses reported high structural empowerment (total CWEQ-II = 22.8). Higher empowerment was significantly correlated with less missed care. Most nurses (77.7%) worked at Magnet hospitals; however, no difference in missed care was found between Magnet and non-Magnet nurses. The average number of patients on the last shift was 5.1. The number of patients cared for was not significantly correlated to missed care; however, nurses' perceptions of better staffing adequacy, teamwork and job satisfaction were. Nurses who intended to leave (25.5%) missed more care. Intention to leave and access to resources predicted missed care. This appears to be the first study examining the relationship between structural empowerment and missed care, demonstrating that higher empowerment was related to greater nurse work effectiveness and improved care delivery. Work environment factors, specifically subjective perceptions of staffing and resource adequacy, were linked to missed care, while nurse-patient ratio was not. Subjective factors may contribute more to missed care than is recognised. Creating and sustaining empowering work environments, ensuring resource adequacy and enhancing factors that promote retention may reduce missed care. No patient/public contribution. None.

This secondary analysis of a cohort from the RHO Implementation Study used COI determined by zip code, dichotomized as low (very low/low) and high (moderate/high/very high) opportunity. Time-to-discontinuation was stratified by COI and maternal race, estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Cox regression (stratified for NICU duration by quantiles) modeled the impact of neonatal variables and COI on HOT duration. Ninety seven infants were included (34 low COI, 63 high COI). Median HOT duration was 96 days for low COI and 64 days for high COI (95% CI: 57-157; 95% CI: 52-80, p = 0.3). Longer NICU stay decreased HOT discontinuation risk (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00, p = 0.002). High COI was not associated with an increased risk of HOT discontinuation (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.83-2.5, p = 0.195). Infants born to Black mothers had longer NICU stays and more often low COI, but not longer HOT use (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.8-2.79, p = 0.206). In a multicenter cohort of infants with PPRD discharged on HOT, low COI, and Black maternal race were not associated with an increased risk for prolonged oxygen use when following a protocoled weaning approach. Further research is needed to assess if standardized HOT management mitigates SDoH-related disparities in oxygen duration.",

      "content": "Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is well-established for its metabolic benefits, including glycemic control and weight loss. Beyond these roles, it exhibits significant anti-inflammatory properties, though the mechanisms remain underexplored. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of liraglutide in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Results demonstrate that increasing concentrations of liraglutide suppresses LPS-elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 6-keto prostaglandin F1α (6-keto-PGF<sub>1α</sub>, a stable prostacyclin metabolite) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), similar to that observed with conventional anti-inflammatory agents, ibuprofen and celecoxib. Mechanistic exploration reveals that liraglutide's anti-inflammatory action is dually-modulated by cyclooxygenase (COX) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling. The application of non-selective, non-competitive nAChR antagonist or selective and potent α7-nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine (MEC) and methyllycaconitine (MLA), respectively, highlights the involvement of cholinergic pathways in liraglutide's activity. Based on in silico molecular docking analyses, liraglutide exhibits favorable binding affinities to COX-1, COX-2, prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), and α7nAChRs, supporting its potential multi-target anti-inflammatory effects.",

The results showed that eugenol achieved 100% mortality for adult ticks at 80 mg/mL and for larvae at 6.25 mg/mL, indicated a high level of efficacy. In contrast, 1,8-cineole resulted in 60% adult tick mortality at 80 mg/mL and 80% larval mortality at 100 mg/mL. The LC<sub>50</sub> values were determined as 4.20 mg/mL and 1.808 mg/mL for eugenol in AIT and LPT, respectively, while 1,8-cineole had LC<sub>50</sub> values of 5.70 mg/mL and 16.34 mg/mL for AIT and LPT, respectively. These findings indicated that eugenol is more effective than 1,8-cineole in killing tick larvae, although both compounds demonstrated similar efficacy in adult tick death by LC<sub>50</sub>. The better efficacy of eugenol suggested its potential as potent herbal acaricide, while 1,8-cineole still shows promise as an alternative.

This study focused on analyzing the connections between HABs and environmental variables in the middle reaches of the Nakdong River in South Korea. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to identify those relationships. The study developed three different PLS-SEM models to investigate various aspects, including lagged effects of environmental factors, influences from upstream and tributaries, and interactions between genera of HABs. The results of the study revealed that the magnitude of HABs had the strongest relationships with nutrient concentrations, particularly 1 week prior to HABs measurement. Additionally, the magnitude of HABs showed stronger relationships with upstream nutrient concentrations compared with tributaries' nutrient concentrations. Furthermore, the dominant genus of HABs in the study area, <i>Microcystis</i>, showed significant relationships with temperature and nutrient concentrations. However, the study did not find significant relationships between <i>Microcystis</i> and other harmful cyanobacteria genera. The methodological framework provides valuable insight into the management of HABs.",

ARTs were established at the click rates of 50 and 300/sec in each ear. The thresholds obtained at the rate of 300/sec were subtracted from those obtained at the rate of 50/sec to derive the cRIF. A general linear repeated measures model was used by setting up the right and left RIF as repeated variables, sex and age as fixed factors, and right and left ear average hearing loss as covariates. This model revealed a medium-sized significant effect of age group [F (1,55) = 4.97; <i>p</i> = .030; Partial Eta Squared: .083], no effect of sex and ear, and no significant interactions. The reduced cRIF of ARTs suggests a significant deterioration in temporal processing speed in the middle-aged group. Future studies to confirm these preliminary results will be helpful.",

Little is known about In Vivo limb pH balance in lower extremity injuries. The aim of this observational study was to quantify acid-base chemistry through invasive measurement of intramuscular pH (IpH) adjacent to tibia fractures. Patients with tibial shaft or plateau fractures undergoing intramedullary nail or external fixator application were included. We compared anterior compartment IpH to venous pH (VpH) measurements at presurgery and 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively, as well as TIMP measurements at the beginning and end of surgery. A total of 39 patients with tibia fractures (11 plateau, 27 shaft) provided consent. Initial IpH was universally acidic (mean [SD] 6.57 [0.506]) compared to VpH (7.35 [0.0600]). Final IpH at 48 h converged to VpH (IpH 7.41 [0.408], VpH 7.40 [0.0305]). IpH and VpH demonstrated a significant positive correlation over all 48 h (r<sub>rm</sub> = 0.476, df = 115, analytic 95% CI [0.322, 0.605], p < 0.0001). There was no correlation between TIMP and IpH (r<sub>rm</sub> = 0.041, df = 33, analytic 95% CI [-0.296, 0.369], p = 0.816). In tibia fractures requiring operative stabilization, adjacent musculature demonstrated nearly 1 order of magnitude more acidic than systemic circulating physiology prior to skeletal stabilization. Limb IpH converged to systemic VpH within 48 h after surgery. No correlation exists between heritage TIMP measurements and direct measures of intramuscular physiology in the form of In Vivo IpH; improvements in diagnostic modalities for muscular diagnoses, such as compartment syndrome, remain valuable. Level of Evidence: Level 2 prospective observational cohort. Clinical Significance: This study provides a critical foundation for understanding the In Vivo acid-base balance of muscle tissue adjacent to fractures, allowing for future research into the consequence of tissue acidity on inflammation, immune response, and fracture healing.",

The expression and biological functions of CYPs are affected by environmental factors, genetic variations, and physiological conditions, which can lead to adverse effects and reduced the therapeutic efficacy of drugs in humans. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the development of probes that can detect the activity of CYPs in complex living systems. This review explores the recent advancements in our understanding of the structure and function of CYPs. It highlights the need to develop specific probes for various CYP subtypes using non-optical, fluorescent and bioluminescent substrates. Furthermore, it summarizes the potential of certain CYP subtypes as therapeutic targets for various diseases. Finally, we explore the challenges and prospects of probes for monitoring CYP activity.",

Similarly, WHI declines from excellent to very poor in TF and from good to poor in NTF. HM pollution index has risen slightly above irrigation safety limits, mainly due to Cd, Ni, and Pb, resulting in a slightly elevated ER.

Cranial bone transport (CBT) technique is a safe, less invasive, and relatively simple surgical technique in bone reconstruction, which has been used to repair cranial bone defects and deformity corrections. The current studies are to determine the effects of CBT surgery on cranial bone regeneration as well as neurological functional recovery in TBI. CBT treatment alleviated lesion size and promoted learning, motor, and memory recovery in TBI rats. The meningeal lymphatic drainage function is enhanced, evidenced by increased intake of ovalbumin conjugated with Alexa Flour 647(OVA-A647) in meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) and deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs).",

Downregulated genes were mostly involved in primary and secondary metabolic pathways, whereas upregulated genes were mostly related to autophagy and nucleotide excision repair. In addition, after TPA treatment, the mycelium swelling and the number of spores decreased. Our study suggests that TPA causes DNA damage, which upregulates the expression of nucleotide excision repair genes Xpb, Xpg, Csb, Polr2, and genome stability regulator gene Rmi1, as well as downregulation of Lsm2 and Dars2 and upregulation of G10, which are related to mRNA spliceosomes, leaving the cell in a state of starvation and triggering lysosomal-, peroxisomal-, and vacuole-autophagy. The autophagosome recycles material from spores, reduces spore production, and induces mycelial swelling, which, in turn, increases lycopene production and storage.",

The setup of this energy-transfer channel greatly reduced the carrier density in QDs under high pump fluences, contributing to a lasing threshold as low as 6.1 μJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The proposed ligand triplet regulation strategy provided new insights into carrier recombination dynamic control and may also be useful for other optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors.",

The study applied a random intercept cross-lagged path model to investigate between- and within-person associations among the three factors. Residual within-wave covariances pointed to intercorrelations among the three factors. We observed significant auto-regressive paths for the three factors at the within-person level, except for the one between FI at T2 and T3. Alternatively, reciprocal cross-lagged effects were observed between LS and PD, and FI predicted less PD. LS mediated the relationship between FI and PD, and likewise, PD mediated that between FI and LS. In conclusion, accounting for between- and within-person variances, the study highlighted the critical role of LS in psychological health among economically disadvantaged youth facing FI issues.",

The roGFP2-PRXIIB probe allowed robust visualization of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in abiotic and biotic stresses, and growing pollen tubes. We further targeted roGFP2-PRXIIB to cytosol, nuclei, mitochondria and chloroplasts to monitor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in real time in different subcellular compartments during immune activation, and the analyses revealed different temporal patterns of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation during pattern- and effector-triggered immune responses in different compartments.

Similar responses were also acquired prospectively from 10 controls, 5 NDR, and 5 MDR subjects, comprising a second dataset. Analysis of variance indicated that both diabetic groups had normal amplitudes elicited by the 31.25 Hz stimulus (fundamental and second harmonic), whereas the 62.5 Hz amplitude was reduced significantly in both diabetic groups. This pattern was found in both the retrospective and prospective analyses. The second harmonic of the 31.25 Hz flicker response (equivalent to 62.5 Hz) was normal in early-stage DR, whereas the response to 62.5 Hz flicker stimuli was abnormal. The second harmonic of the ISCEV standard 30 Hz flicker ERG does not appear to be a useful indicator of neural dysfunction in early DR.",
