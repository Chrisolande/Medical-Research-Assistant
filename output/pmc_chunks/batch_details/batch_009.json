      "content": "A study was conducted to explore motivations and factors that influence decision-making processes of parents who presented their child to ED for non-urgent conditions. An exploratory study using a qualitative descriptive design was undertaken to address research aims. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of eight parents who presented their child (birth to 14 years of age), to ED for non-urgent conditions. Parental decision-making regarding ED presentations were influenced by a constellation of factors; however, three main themes emerged. These included <i>Parental Anxiety</i>, <i>There is Only One Place</i>, and <i>Mitigating Perceived Delay or Inaccessibility</i>. As such, centred on how parents addressed their anxiety when a child was ill, accessibility and capacity of EDs to provide immediate relief to parents and children, and parents' perception that accessing other healthcare services impacted crucial time for treatment. EDs remain a preferred healthcare service to address non-urgent paediatric needs, despite adequate health literacy among participants. When improving models of care within EDs, non-urgent presentations must be considered, including management of parental anxiety, along with establishing non-urgent care adjacent to or integrated within an ED.",

      "content": "polysaccharides (PEP) have been shown to ameliorate colitis through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota-modulating properties. However, the potential of PEP in combating obesity remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the physicochemical characteristics of PEP and its mechanisms in modulating lipid metabolism in C57BL/6 mice treated with a high-fat diet (HFD). PEP is a high molecular weight, non-crystalline, sheet-like, heat-stable, α-acidic pyran polysaccharide rich in galactose and galacturonic acid. <i>In vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that administering PEP and atorvastatin (positive control) significantly reversed weight gain, adipose tissue hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, liver steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation induced by a HFD. Mechanistically, PEP counteracted obesity by upregulating gene expression related to lipolysis (ATGL, HSL, and AMPKα), β-oxidation (SIRT1, PGC-1α, PPARα, CPT-1A, and MCAD), and cholesterol metabolism (LXRα and LXRβ), while downregulating the <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis axis (C/EBPα, PPARγ, SREBP1, ACC1, and FAS) and HMGCR, thereby enhancing fecal lipid excretion. Remarkably, PEP treatment decreased obesity-promoting bacteria (<i>Anaeroplasma</i> and <i>Clostridia_vadinBB60_group</i>) while increasing obesity-repressed flora (<i>Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Romboutsia</i>, and <i>Turicibacter</i>). These changes correlated with increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which inhibited NF-κB <i>via</i> binding to GPR41/43. In summary, PEP promotes lipid metabolism and fecal fat excretion and exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that are strongly linked to gut microbiota manipulation. These findings reveal the potential of PEP as a functional food ingredient for obesity prevention.",

Hormonal analysis revealed lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and higher estradiol (E2) levels in the observation group compared to the control. Furthermore, ovarian reserve markers such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count were also higher in the observation group. Bone metabolism improvements were noted, with higher osteocalcin (OST) and lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) levels. The observation group also had a significantly lower recurrence rate (7.3%) after 24 months, compared to the control group (16.8%).

At the same time, the teeth in the projection of the cyst retained their vitality in all cases, which was confirmed by the cold test and continued root growth after cystectomy. On OPG, ICCs were manifested by a wide variety of localizations (in the bifurcation projection, below, distal or medial to the roots of the teeth), but CBCT made it possible to detect a common symptom - predominantly the vestibular location of the lesion. Cystectomy without endodontic treatment of teeth in the projection of the cyst turned out to be a successful treatment tactic, which is confirmed by observation for 6 -84 months without recurrence of ICCs and dental complications.",

The analysis included a comparison of the volumes of the 3D MC models at T1 and T2, as well as measuring the T1-T2 distances of the 3D MC models at the poles of five surfaces (superior, anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral). A correlation was determined between the extent of maxillomandibular advancement (MMA), counterclockwise rotation of the occlusal plane (CCWROP), and morphological changes in the MC. A decrease in MC volume was observed postoperatively, averaging 14.5% (<i>p</i><0.001). T1-T2 distance changes showed more pronounced remodeling with a reduction in the distance between the poles on the superior and posterior surfaces of the MC compared to the other surfaces. However, the lack of differences in all paired comparisons of changes in intersurface distances of the 3D MC models at the poles of the five surfaces at T1 and T2 (<i>p</i>>0.05) indicates uniform volume reduction in the MC. No correlation was found between morphological changes in the MC and the degree of MMA or CCWROP. Morphological changes in the MC at T2 were not accompanied by clinical manifestations in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Morphological changes in the MC after bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with MMA in patients with Class II skeletal malocclusion are within the range of functional remodeling, do not lead to TMJ dysfunction or occlusal disturbances. However, the reduction in MC volume approaches the threshold values for condylar resorption.",

Both the Donnan effect and pore size changes influence ion transport within nanochannels, with an enhanced Donnan effect promoting cation transport while slowing anion permeation. The combined effect of the electrostatic interaction and steric sieving expands the membrane rejection adjustment range from 9.6% to 27.6%, as the applied voltage simultaneously decreases pore size and increases Donnan exclusion. The reduction in pore size enhances the ability of the per unit of Donnan potential to regulate ion transport, and electrostatic exclusion is more pronounced in smaller nanochannels. The same conclusion is confirmed in commercial nanofiltration membranes of varying sizes (NF270 and NF800), but as the nanochannel size decreases further (NF90), the effect of electrostatic interaction on ion transport becomes minimal. Since the nanochannels are too narrow to permit ion transport, size sieving becomes the dominant mechanism for selective separation. This work enhances our understanding of ion transport in nanochannels and supports the development of high-performance nanofiltration membranes.",

We anticipate that this synthetic strategy can be adapted to different approaches, such as liquid interfaces or insulating substrates, to synthesize high-quality 2D MOFs. Accompanied by the high control with atomic precision over the magnetic properties of the ligands and metals, this approach enables the formation of large-scale 2D MOFs with complex spin interactions, which will open new avenues in the field of 2D magnetic materials.",

Furthermore, TPT mitigated the increase of intestinal permeability in LPS-induced mice, thereby modulating inflammation progression and its transmission to the hippocampus. It also enhances synaptic plasticity by regulating microglial and astrocyte activation. The protective mechanism of TPT on synaptic plasticity involves increasing dendritic spine density, particularly enhancing the proportion of mushroom spines, and mitigating synaptic ultrastructural damage. These findings suggest that <i>T. matsutake</i> mitigates memory impairment and that the relative amount of protein plays a more prominent prophylactic role. This provides valuable insights for developing nutritional products to prevent neurodegenerative diseases.",

This controlled feeding approach ensures a more uniform distribution of DOT repeat units within the hydrophobic core block, significantly improves copolymer composition control, enables DOT incorporation of up to ∼4 mol %, and enhances overall comonomer conversion. Compared to conventional one-shot batch syntheses, this strategy yielded vesicles with superior degradation profiles. Morphological characterization using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of well-defined vesicles. Hydrolytic degradation studies conducted in mildly basic aqueous media led to vesicle disintegration, as indicated by cryo-TEM, DLS, and SAXS analyses. Importantly, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis revealed the formation of significantly shorter copolymer chains and final molecular weight distributions comparable to that of the nondegradable PDMAC precursor, indicating efficient hydrolytic degradation of the membrane-forming P(MEA-<i>stat</i>-DOT) block. This study provides valuable insights regarding the rational design of degradable vinyl-based diblock copolymer vesicles, which augurs well for potential biomedical applications.",

We performed a 2-center cohort study comparing 2 different institutional approaches, with either LP or EVD as initial treatment. Patients with SAH treated within 72 hours for hydrocephalus, with Glasgow Coma Scale ≥7 and no contraindications for LP, were included. We calculated odds ratios with adjustment (aOR) for baseline predictors to compare the rates of permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs), clinical and radiological complications and unfavorable functional outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1-3 at 3 months) between the 2 strategies. On admission, patients had comparable median Glasgow Coma Scale scores (LP group: 14, IQR = 13-14; EVD group: 14, IQR = 13-14), relative bicaudate indices (LP group: 1.2, IQR = 1.1-1.3; EVD group: 1.1, IQR = 1.0-1.3), and Hijdra scores (LP group: 21, IQR = 15-28; EVD group: 23, IQR = 12-28).",

      "content": "Conjugated polymers are vital in the fabrication of OFETs due to their ability to conduct charge carriers. However, structural disorder at the interfaces of these thin films can significantly disrupt the alignment and arrangement of the polymer chains, leading to irregular and unpredictable diffusion patterns. This disorganized structure impedes the efficient transfer of charge carriers, which is crucial for the optimal performance of OFETs. Our comprehensive analysis employs X-ray scattering methods to accurately determine the crystallization induced by interface disorder in isoindigo-BTBT films, resulting from surface and interface interactions in a non-destructive manner. Analysis of X-ray reflectivity (XRR)-derived electron density profiles reveals the stacking of polymer chains within the middle of the film, accompanied by disordered arrangements at both the air-polymer and polymer-substrate interfaces. To elucidate the origins of interface disorder, we used classical nucleation theory, thickness-dependent XRR studies, and statistical analysis of surface morphology at various annealing temperatures. Furthermore, fabricating bottom gate top contact OFETs revealed reduced field effect mobility with increased disorder. This highlights the need to address disorder at the polymer-substrate interface to improve charge transport efficiency in these devices. By understanding and mitigating the effects of disorder at the semiconductor-dielectric interface, we can enhance the performance of OFETs, paving the way for more reliable and efficient organic electronic devices.",

      "content": "The transcriptomic analyses in the presence of PROG showed the overexpression of <i>EGO55_13845</i> and <i>EGO55_13860</i> genes, coding a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) and a luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), respectively. Both genes are located next to two regulatory proteins forming a small gene cluster (named <i>pdc</i>) that can be found in other steroid-degrading bacteria. Mutagenic analyses and gene complementation allowed ascertaining that <i>EGO55_13845</i> and <i>EGO55_13860</i> genes are involved in PROG degradation. To assess their enzymatic activities, both proteins were overexpressed in <i>Escherichia coli,</i> showing that they catalyze a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenation of PROG, resulting in the production of testosterone acetate. They are also active on 1,2-dehydroprogesterone, an intermediate in PROG degradation, converting it into boldenone acetate. BVMO and LLM enzymes are functionally redundant, as each can replace the other in metabolizing PROG. The presence of two functionally redundant BVMO and LLM enzymes in <i>C. tardaugens</i> can be explained by their distinct substrate preferences. Our results settle for the first time the genetic and biochemical basis for explaining how PROG is recognized and channeled into the 9,10-seco degradation pathway in a PROG-degrading bacterium. IMPORTANCEThis study investigates for the first time the key steps in bacterial progesterone (PROG) degradation, revealing new insights into the process. The main stages of PROG degradation were examined in the bacterium <i>Caenibius tardaugens</i>. The conducted transcriptomic analysis allows identifying the progesterone degradation cluster <i>pdc,</i> which is also present in other related bacteria. We demonstrated that Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and luciferase-like monooxygenase encoded within the <i>pdc</i> cluster catalyze the PROG Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenation, producing testosterone acetate. The activity redundancy can be explained by the difference in substrate specificity of each enzyme.",

Here, we present a challenging exome-negative case of familial SPD. The case was resolved using long-read genome sequencing, which revealed a microdeletion in a conserved noncoding regulatory region upstream of the HOXD cluster. Oxford Nanopore WGS-LRS was pursued on two affected sisters, followed by CMA-Cytoscan HT validation. WGS-LRS for two affected siblings revealed a shared microdeletion of ~5.6 kb upstream of EVX2 and HOXD13 [chr2:176073523-176,079,120 (hg38)]. The deletion is predicted to affect the enhancer of several HOXD genes (EH38E2053988) and overlaps with a short stretch of high-sequence homology between human and mouse, called R1. CMA-Cytoscan HT analysis and PCR validation approved segregation of the deletion in the siblings and revealed a paternal inheritance. Our findings expand the genotype-phenotype correlation of the regulatory region upstream of HOXD13 in SPD and highlight the utility of long-read WGS for detecting noncoding variants that are undetectable by exome sequencing.",

      "content": "Targeting the gut microbiota represents a novel avenue to delay aging and aging-related physical and mental decline. However, the underlying mechanism by which the microbiota modulates the aging process, particularly age-related physical and behavioral changes is not completely understood. We conducted fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young or old male donor mice to the old male recipients. Old recipients with young microbiota had a higher alpha diversity than the old recipients with old microbiota. Compared to FMT with old microbiota, FMT with young microbiota reduced body weight and prevented fat accumulation in the old recipients. FMT with young microbiota also lowered frailty, increased grip strength, and alleviated depression and anxiety-like behavior in the old recipients. Consistent with observed physical changes, untargeted metabolomic analysis of serum and stools revealed that FMT with young microbiota lowered age-related long-chain fatty acid levels and increased amino acid levels in the old recipients. Bulk RNAseq analysis of the amygdala of the brain showed that FMT with young microbiota downregulated inflammatory pathways and upregulated oxidative phosphorylation in the old recipients. Our results demonstrate that FMT with young microbiota has substantial positive influences on age-related body composition, frailty, and psychological behaviors. These effects are associated with changes in host lipid and amino acid metabolism in the periphery and transcriptional regulation of neuroinflammation and energy utilization in the brain. The gut microbiome is a key hallmark of aging. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using young microbiota represents a novel rejuvenation strategy to delay aging. Our study provides compelling evidence that transplanting microbiota from young mice significantly improved grip strength, frailty, and body composition in aged recipient mice. At the molecular level, FMT improved aging-related metabolic markers in the gut and circulation. Additionally, FMT from young microbiota rejuvenated the amygdala of the aged brain by downregulating inflammatory pathways. This study highlights the importance of metabolic reprogramming via young microbiota FMT in improving physical and metabolic health in elderly recipients.",

Common native and some non-native species with low invasive potential dominated the average productive system. These species had functional diversity similar to that of natural vegetation but had a slightly different functional profile. Simulated systems were dominated by plant species with more acquisitive functional strategies than native flora. The adoption of our biocultural approach to restoration programs in the region illustrates the importance of local participation; local selection of species for restoration had little effect on ecosystem functional diversity. Our framework can be readily adapted to various contexts for evaluating cultural preferences and the ecological efficacy of biocultural restoration initiatives globally.",

This study presents the first theory-driven framework that links the triboelectric behavior of MXenes to their atomic-scale properties. It also introduces a computational approach for benchmarking triboelectric materials, offering an alternative to the traditional triboelectric series method. By combining analytical models with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we evaluate 48 MXene members (M<sub>2</sub>XT<sub>2</sub>, M = Ti, V, Cr, and Mn; X = C and N; and Tx = F, O, OH, Cl, H, and N) based on key physicochemical parameters: bandgap, work function, surface charge density, and effective density of states. Results highlight the exceptional potential of specific MXenes, such as Mn<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>NF<sub>2</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>NN<sub>2</sub>, and Cr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, as negative friction layers and electron trappers due to their high work function and superior charge density. Additionally, OH MXenes like V<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>N(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and Ti<sub>2</sub>N(OH)<sub>2</sub> demonstrate optimal performance as positive friction layers.",

Primary outcomes encompassed oxygen saturation (SpO₂), adverse events (aspiration, choking, mucosal bleeding), sedation efficacy, and surgeon satisfaction. The NPA group demonstrated superior SpO₂ maintenance at key procedural stages (p<0.05), with a 78% reduction in hypoxemia episodes compared to controls. Notably, aspiration and choking incidents decreased significantly (p<0.05), yielding a fourfold lower overall adverse event rate (6.67% vs. 30.00%, p=0.001). Sedation quality metrics revealed enhanced behavioral cooperation (p<0.001) and optimal sedation depth (Ramsay scores: p<0.001) in the NPA cohort, though pain perception remained comparable between groups (p>0.05). Surgeons reported 93.33% satisfaction with NPA-assisted cases versus 33.33% with conventional methods (p<0.001), correlating with fewer procedural interruptions. These findings establish NPA as a clinically superior modality for pediatric dental sedation, offering dual benefits of improved oxygenation stability and procedural workflow efficiency. The technology addresses critical gaps in perioperative safety while maintaining hemodynamic equilibrium, positioning it as a viable optimization strategy for high-risk pediatric populations.",

      "content": "Microglial activation contributes to the progression of CIBP. 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, could inhibit microglial activation. Its effect on CIBP remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of 2-DG in CIBP mice and underlying mechanisms. In this research, we established a CIBP mouse model by injecting Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells into the bone marrow of the femur. Relevant pain behaviors were assessed by measuring the paw withdrawal threshold and spontaneous hind limb lifting. Additionally, the glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG was intrathecally administered to treat CIBP in mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques were employed to analyze microglial activation and M1/M2 phenotype markers in the spinal cord. Our findings demonstrated significant microglial activation and polarization toward the M1 phenotype in the spinal cord of CIBP mice. Intrathecal administration of 2-DG effectively alleviated pain-related behaviors in CIBP mice. Furthermore, this treatment suppressed microglial activation and M1 polarization, while significantly restoring levels of the M2 phenotype. Additionally, 2-DG attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while boosting the secretion of the anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) in the spinal cord of CIBP mice. Notably, 2-DG effectively suppresses microglia activation and M1 polarization in LPS+IFN-γ-induced BV-2 cells by downregulating CD86, iNOS expression, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 levels while upregulating Arg-1, CD206 expression and IL-10 level. These results suggest that 2-DG ameliorates mechanical allodynia, spontaneous pain and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord of CIBP mice by promoting the transition from the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype. This study may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of CIBP.",

Plasma samples were obtained from anticoagulation-naïve participants, before initiation of study medication (n = 1841). Fibrin clot turbidimetry was performed, and lysis time determined. Associations between lysis time and characteristics, biomarkers, and on-treatment bleeding and cardiovascular events were assessed by lysis time quartile (Q1-4, shortest to longest). A shorter lysis time was associated with being older, male, permanent AF, lower body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate and C-reactive protein, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.",

      "content": "The adsorption-elution test and genotyping are recommended tests for confirmation. However, turnaround time and the availability of instruments, reagents, and budget, as well as technical issues are challenging factors of DEL identification in laboratory practice and patient safety. To develop a screening predictive algorithm for DEL and Rh-negative, the serological tests of RhCcEe antigen and adsorption-elution tests were computed using a machine learning model. The machine learning algorithm computed the data based on RhCcEe antigen with or without a DEL confirmative serological test like the adsorption-elution test. The predictive accuracy gave >90% for RhD-negative identification in a Thai blood donor dataset. To screen for RhD-negative, we provided the web application named RhDnostics at https://rnp-project-1.streamlit.app/. Our machine learning algorithm could be used as a predictive tool for RhD-negative screening in the laboratory with no confirmative serological test or RHD molecular testing available.",

      "content": "By February 2020, the virus had spread to Europe and was subsequently transmitted worldwide. Italy was the fifth-most affected country worldwide and the fourth-most affected country in Europe. Beginning on February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020, the Italian government suspended all teaching activities in schools and universities. In 2020, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to dental hygiene students in the Emilia Romagna Region, one of the most severely affected regions in Italy. The survey evaluated the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on educational activities and training among students, as well as its emotional consequences. In 2022, the questionnaire was administered to students in the same University courses. Considering the 3-year duration of the course, some respondents to the first survey were working during the second survey, whereas others were scheduled to graduate soon. This survey evaluated the emotional impact of the pandemic on recent graduates and future dental hygienists; it also explored the potential influences of emotions, such as anxiety and anger, in the workplace. In total, 39, 48, and 41 respondents experienced quite intense/intense, moderate, or mild anger, respectively. The proportion of respondents experiencing anger increased from 46% in 2020 to 67.7% in 2022 (128 of 189). Anger and anxiety persisted at 2 years, as evidenced by responses to the second survey conducted in 2022, although the proportions differed compared with 2020. Changes in anger and anxiety among students over time should be monitored. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether anger among students can be replaced by positive emotions after entry into the workforce, suggesting compensation for their efforts. If negative emotions persist, new workers may exhibit emotional responses and aggressive social behaviors.",

Additionally, a surgical guide was performed to correctly guide the preparation of the implant sites with two WhiteSky ceramic implants located (WhiteSky, Bredent, Germany). A week following the surgical guide, a provisional prosthesis was placed. Subsequent six months later, a definitive prosthesis was cemented. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed for sixteen years to determine peri-implant tissue health. The implant-prosthetic rehabilitation demonstrates excellent aesthetic and functional outcomes according to the PES and WES index. Following sixteen years of clinical reviews, both the ceramic implants appear clinically in sound health, and alveolar bone involvement radiographically appreciable. Zirconia implants appear to give excellent clinical and radiographically results long term with both alveolar bone and gingival tissues stability in the aesthetic area.",

Impella 5.0 or 5.5 management was performed for 87 patients at Osaka University Hospital between October 2017 and November 2023. Impella-related adverse events occurred in 36 patients. The rates of freedom from Impella-related adverse events at 10, 20, and 30 days were 60, 49, and 39%, respectively. Bleeding events, stroke events, and hemolysis occurred in 20, 12, and 6 patients, respectively. The distances between the inflow part and left ventricular structure at systole and diastole in the patients with Impella-related adverse events were shorter than those in the patients without Impella-related adverse events (systole: 2 ± 2 vs. 8 ± 7 mm, p < 0.01; diastole: 4 ± 3 vs. 11 ± 7 mm, p < 0.01). A short distance between the inflow and left ventricular structure is a risk factor for Impella-related adverse events. It may be important that the inflow part of Impella 5.0 or 5.5 is not close to the left ventricular structure.",

      "content": "This retrospective, single-center cohort study reviewed 203 consecutive cases of vascular access thrombosis treated between January 2015 and December 2023. Among them, 43 cases of AVG thrombosis with a first-time occlusion and successful revascularization were included for analysis. A per-protocol analysis focusing on postintervention outcomes was conducted among patients who underwent surgical thrombectomy and/or endovascular intervention. Residual anastomotic thrombus was assessed on intraoperative final angiography. All cases were divided into those with residual anastomotic thrombus and those without. The primary outcome measure was postintervention assisted primary patency (PAPP). In addition, hazard ratios of each variable for postintervention patency were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. All 43 patients were divided into two groups: 12 patients (27.9%) with residual anastomotic thrombus and 31 patients (72.1%) without residual anastomotic thrombus. During a median follow-up period of 19 months, PAPP was significantly lower in cases with residual anastomotic thrombus than those without (residual thrombus: 38.1% at 90 days, 19.1% at 180 days, and 19.1% at 365 days; non-residual thrombus: 93.2% at 90 days, 85.7% at 180 days, and 74.6% at 365 days; log-rank <i>p</i> < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in postintervention secondary patency between cases with residual anastomotic thrombus and those without (residual thrombus: 75.0% at 90 days, 65.6% at 180 days, and 65.6% at 365 days; non-residual thrombus: 96.8% at 90 days, 96.8% at 180 days, and 93.1% at 365 days; log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.148). Multivariate analysis identified residual thrombus as an independent risk factor for PAPP (hazard ratio 5.57; 95% confidence interval 2.40-12.93; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), as well as variables including endovascular intervention. AVG thrombosis with residual thrombus at the anastomotic site during intervention showed significantly lower PAPP than those without. Residual anastomotic thrombus may be a relevant factor associated with patency outcomes, and further prospective evaluation is warranted to assess its utility as a treatment endpoint of intervention for AVG thrombosis.",

Herein, a valid inorganic-organic coupling strategy is developed to enhance Pd-O coordination bonds within Pd-SAC for reconciling activity and stability. Nickel hydroxide enriched with Ni<sup>2+</sup> vacancies is utilized to bind Pd centers, and dimethylglyoxime (DMG) bonds with its OH groups by H<sub>2</sub> reduction, forming a Pd-O-DMG structure. Compared with the pristine Pd-O structure, whose activity descends greatly during the recycling process, the Pd-O-DMG structure makes the activity unchanged after 6 used times for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. The Pd-SAC has mild and economic reaction conditions (at 70 °C under air in ethanol without excess base) and good substrate tolerance. Further theoretical calculations show that coupled DMG induces hydrogen bonds on O atoms of the oxazole around Pd centers and thus strengthens Pd-O coordination bonds to exhibit good stability and activity.",

The devices exhibit an average on-off ratio of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> and show minimal degradation when stretched up to 40%. Single-pulse, paired-pulse, and repetitive-pulse responses are also demonstrated, showing their ability to work as artificial synapses. The devices exhibit a high linearity of ≤1 with 100 distinct conductance states in long-term plasticity and a dynamic range of 15. Furthermore, we conducted a handwritten digit recognition simulation, achieving a learning accuracy of over 90%. We believe our work can serve as a guide for developing high-performance stretchable synaptic devices for various applications.",

Techniques included hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, LDH assay, ELISA, echocardiography, measurement of MDA, GSH, Fe2<sup>+</sup>, real-time PCR, and western blot analysis. Administration of Feno significantly mitigated myocardial injury by reducing serum CK-MB levels from 963.8 U/L to 512.5 U/L, cTnI from 0.65 g/L to 0.36 g/L, and LDH from 552.4 U/L to 372.1 U/L. Feno improved cardiac function by increasing ejection fraction from 65.5% to 78.5% and fractional shortening from 42.3% to 57.3%. Feno also inhibited inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, reduced MDA levels, increased GSH levels, and restored GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11 expression. The protective effects of Feno may be associated with the YAP1 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that Feno has the potential to protect against LPS-induced cardiac injury through the alleviation of ferroptosis, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for septic cardiomyopathy. However, the study is limited by the use of a single animal model and the lack of translational data in humans.",

Peptoids represent a promising class of peptidomimetics with proven activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and show less susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. In this study, building on our previous design of dimeric peptoids, 22 amino and guanidino compounds of functionalized phenyl-dimeric peptoids were synthesized, incorporating electron-withdrawing and donating substituents, as well as the parent peptoid without substituents. The electronic nature of the substituent and the guanidino group played a vital role in tuning the peptoid antibacterial activity. Guanidino peptoids <b>11h</b>, <b>11i</b>, and <b>11f</b> were the most effective peptoids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MICs of 0.75 to 2.6 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strains and MICs of 6 to 10.9 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> against <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Guanidino peptoids in the presence of the electron-withdrawing group, including halogens and a nitro group, or in the presence of moderate electron-donating groups such as methyl and <i>tert</i>-butyl, showed the best activity against bacteria, especially Gram-positive strains.",

Amniocentesis was performed for all pregnant women, with both karyotyping and CMA conducted. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and KEGG pathway analyses were conducted for isolated and complex CHD cases. CMA and karyotype detected total abnormalities in 22 % of all CHD fetuses, including a chromosomal aneuploidy rate of 7.2 %, a pathogenic CNV (pCNV) rate of 6.1 %. The overall detection rates for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 11.6 %, 12.5 %, and 50 %, respectively. Group 3 exhibited significantly higher rates of chromosomal aneuploidy (23.7 %) and pCNV (17.8 %) compared to Groups 1 and 2 (p < <i>0.001</i>). No significant differences in maternal age were observed among the three CHD groups. KEGG pathway analysis identified the top three enriched pathways for complex CHD were nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell adhesion molecules, and the mRNA surveillance pathway. The rates of chromosomal aneuploidy and CNV abnormalities in CHD cases with extracardiac anomalies were significantly higher than in the other two groups. Maternal age was not associated with the chromosomal abnormalities observed in CHD cases. KEGG pathway analysis indicated more intricate molecular pathways in complex CHD.",

The trial included a 28-day screening period, a 20-week main trial period, and an optional 44-week multiple-dose extension period. Participants were dosed on Day 1 and had follow-up visits at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 20. The extension period included three additional eptinezumab infusions every 12 weeks. Primary PK endpoints included area under the curve (from zero to infinity; AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>) of eptinezumab and maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). The effect of eptinezumab on migraine-related disability was explored using the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment. A total of 28 participants (12 children [aged 6-11 years] and 16 adolescents [aged 12-17 years]) were enrolled in the trial, with 23 continuing into the extension period. A single intravenous administration of eptinezumab at 150 mg or 300 mg resulted in similar mean plasma concentration-time curves (mean AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>: 92,890 h·μg/mL [150 mg], 95,550 h·μg/mL [300 mg]; mean C<sub>max</sub>: 131.8 μg/mL [150 mg], 141.2 μg/mL [300 mg]). The PK profile of eptinezumab after multiple intravenous administrations in the extension period was also similar. No serious adverse events (AEs) or severe treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were observed. The most common TEAE was orthostatic hypotension, reported in three adolescents (11% of total population). Other TEAEs occurred as single incidences. Improvement in migraine-associated disability was seen in both children and adolescents after a single intravenous administration of eptinezumab (median [range] score changes from baseline to Week 12 were -22 [-70, -6] in children and -17.0 [-117, 42] in adolescents) and was maintained during the extension period. The PK profile in children and adolescents was consistent across different dose levels and weight groups. These results support the use of weight-based eptinezumab dosing in children and adolescents with migraine. Eptinezumab was generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals observed in this population relative to those observed in adults.",

      "content": "In recent years, the demand for TF has rapidly increased due to its pivotal role in preoperative coagulation tests. However, large-scale production of TF remains challenging despite successful recombinant expression, as incorrect post-translational modifications adversely affect TF activity. This study aims to investigate the role of post-translational modifications, specifically N-glycosylation, in TF activity and stability. Additionally, it explores strategies to enhance TF production by reducing its degradation through genetic modulation. We compared TF activity derived from human cells and E. coli to assess the impact of post-translational modifications. Furthermore, we examined the effect of N-glycosylation on TF function. To address TF degradation, we knocked out the HRD1 gene, a key component of the endoplasmic- reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and evaluated its impact on TF stability and activity. TF produced in human cells exhibited higher activity than TF expressed in E. coli, emphasizing the importance of post-translational modifications. Specifically, N-glycosylation was found to influence TF activity and stability significantly. Additionally, we observed that knocking out the HRD1 gene effectively reduced TF degradation without compromising its activity. Our findings underscore the crucial role of N-glycosylation in TF function and stability. Moreover, the modulation of the ERAD pathway through HRD1 knockout presents a promising approach for enhancing TF production. These insights could contribute to the large-scale manufacturing of functionally active TF for clinical and research applications.",

The aim of this study is to screen biomarkers that can distinguish LTBI from ATB patients by using a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis strategy. The transcriptomic datasets were obtained from the GEO database. Hub genes and critical signal pathways for differentiating latent and active TB, were identified by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis strategy comprising Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and hub genes were verified by RT-qPCR in this study. The transcriptome profiles of GSE193777, GSE157657, GSE168519, GSE107991, and GSE107992 were extracted from the GEO database, in which a total of 18,397 protein-coding genes from 206 samples were included in the bioinformatics analysis. Combined with Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network, differentially expressed gene, functional enrichment, and proteinprotein interaction analyses, six hub genes were identified. The results of RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression levels of four hub genes (HLA-DOA, ECH1, PARN and TRAPPC4) were downregulated in the LTBI group compared with the ATB group. Our findings may provide crucial clues to potential biomarkers that can distinguish patients with LTBI from those with ATB, aiding the understanding of the mechanism underlying the progression of LTBI to ATB.",

Key gene modules in the GSE73540 dataset were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Three BC-related datasets (GSE73540, GSE22820, and GSE36295) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were applied for additional examination of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Intersection analysis selected ARL6IP1 as a hub gene for prognostic analysis. In vitro experiments investigated how ARL6IP1 knockdown influences BC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), oxidative stress, and glycolysis. The connection between ARL6IP1 and an OLFM4 was confirmed using Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and their roles in BC tumor progression and glycolysis were evaluated. ARL6IP1 was elevated in BC datasets and linked with poor BC prognosis. Experiments demonstrated that knockdown of ARL6IP1 significantly reduced BC cell growth while promoting apoptosis and oxidative stress. Besides, ARL6IP1 knockdown reduced glycolysis, as manifested by decreased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glucose consumption, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and lactate production while increasing mitochondrial respiration (OCR). Co-IP validated the connection between ARL6IP1 and OLFM4, and OLFM4 overexpression partially counteracted the suppression of glycolysis and cell behavior resulting from ARL6IP1 knockdown. ARL6IP1 is a critical regulator of BC progression, influencing glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and key cellular behaviors. Targeting the ARL6IP1-OLFM4 axis offers a promising therapeutic strategy for managing BC.",

According to a recent survey, 1-2% of the Indian population suffers from major mental disorders and 5% suffers from minor mental disorders. Epilepsy is among those mental disorders that affect 30 million people worldwide. Currently, the treatment of epilepsy involves agents which modulate sodium-ion channels, enhance GABAergic transmission, and agents with multiple modes of action. Various classes of synthetic drugs are used to treat epilepsy, but these drugs are often challenged due to their unwanted side effects. Medicinal plants have been a part of human society which combating diseases from the dawn of civilization. The plant Cyanthillium cinereum (L.) H. Rob. is mainly found in the Himalayas from Kashmir to Nepal at an altitude of 8000 m. Decoction of this plant is traditionally used as an anti-cancer, anti-malarial, anti-epileptic, and in neurosis and skin diseases.

The bio-active extract was characterized using FTIR and GC techniques. In vivo antioxidants like GSH and SOD level, oxidative stress markers- MDA and hemoglobin and platelet count were also estimated in the animal brain. Amongst all extracts tested, only ethanol extract of Cyanthillium cinereum significantly (p<0.05) inhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures in PTZ-induced epilepsy in mice in a dose (100 or 200 mg/kg., p.o.) dependent manner. The dose of 200 mg/kg of extract exhibited the most significant effect. It is also found that treatment with ethanol extract on PTZ-induced epilepsy in mice significantly (p<0.05) reduces the duration of convulsion and delays the onset of clonic convulsion. The present findings suggest that the high amounts of phenols and flavonoids in the ethanol extract could be responsible for the anti-epileptic effect. Moreover, the ethanol extract also restored GSH, SOD and hemoglobin and platelet level and decreased oxidative marker- MDA content in the mice brain.",

      "content": "The ecosystem and human health are seriously at risk from contamination of heavy metals in water. A variety of pollution indices are used in this study to analyze the presence of heavy metal contamination in groundwater and used Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the health hazards associated with it. In two seasons the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater samples were taken in triplicate from 25 sites in South Kashmir, which is situated in the southern portion of the northwest Himalayas. The research area had higher than average quantities of heavy metals, according to the results. The cold climate probably had no seasonal influence on groundwater quality, but concentrations were generally greater in pre-monsoon than in the post-monsoon. To evaluate contamination, the study employed the following pollution indices: NPI (80%), HEI (76%), MI (80%), CoD (76%), and HPI (0%). There were found to be strong correlations between these indices, with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.96, 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95 between HEI and HPI, HEI and MI, HEI and Cd, and HEI and NPI, among other high correlations. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation for many exposure pathways showed that youngsters had a greater 95th percentile of carcinogenic risk than adults. The heavy metals were graded according to their non-carcinogenic risk using the Hazard Index (HI) as follows: Pb > Ni > Mn > Cd > Cu > Fe > Zn. For adults, the non-carcinogenic risk was shown to be 4.92E-01, while for children, it was 1.41E+01. Human health risk evaluations also showed that youngsters had a greater overall cancer risk (OCR) (1.61E-01) than adults (4.74E-03). PRACTITIONER POINTS: Groundwater Quality Monitoring: The study highlights the critical need for regular groundwater quality monitoring, particularly in areas prone to heavy metal contamination, like South Kashmir. This is essential for the early detection of hazardous metal levels and the mitigation of public health risks. Use of Pollution Indices: Pollution indices such as NPI, HEI, MI, and CoD can be effective tools for assessing and quantifying heavy metal contamination in water sources, providing a comprehensive understanding of the contamination levels. Health Risk Assessment: Monte Carlo simulations for human health risk assessments underscore the importance of prioritizing children's health, as they are at greater risk of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects from heavy metal exposure.",

The analyses showed that, after controlling for several covariates, physical abuse was not associated with any physio-psychological aspects of sexual dysfunction. However, emotional abuse was significantly associated with all aspects of physio-psychological functioning except for reaching climax more quickly than the man would have liked and experiencing pain as a result of sex. The results have important implications for relationship therapy and intimacy counselling, with greater awareness of how emotional abuse impacts sexual functioning providing valuable insight for men and their partners. The study used data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health, which sourced data from a nationally representative sample of Australian men. A potential limitation is that individual Natsal-SF items were used in lieu of the total score, and thus the same variance may be explained in multiple analyses. The results suggest that emotional abuse is more damaging to male sexual functioning than physical abuse.",

The potential of L-cysteine capped with AuNPs (L-Cys-AuNPs) as chiral selectors for the recognition of ketoprofen enantiomers has been investigated using UV-Vis, FESEM, FT-IR, SERS, and zeta potential. The recognition process is easily identified by the naked eye or by using a UV-Vis spectrometer. Sensors L-Cys-AuNPs revealed a good linear response to ketoprofen enantiomers in the concentration range of 8.33-33.33 μM with a relative standard deviation of 3.08%. And detection limit of 2.35 μM. The proposed method was applied to determine the ketoprofen racemic mixture in water samples and commercial tablets. This method represents easy, inexpensive, simple, and very effective methods for the recognition of ketoprofen enantiomers.",

      "content": "However, there are remaining research gaps and no clear consensus on the definition of remission. We consolidated post hoc remission data from clinical trials and real-world studies of benralizumab in patients with SEA to gather insights on: testing different definitions; predictors of remission; the effect of comorbidities on achieving remission; remission and background medication reduction; long-term remission patterns with benralizumab; and remission in a real-life setting. In the SIROCCO and CALIMA Phase 3 randomised studies, patients with remission had higher baseline median blood eosinophil counts, were more likely to have a FEV<sub>1</sub> of ≥ 65% predicted, had fewer exacerbations within 12 months and had lower mean ACQ-6 scores. Compared with the overall population, patients with a history of nasal polyps were also more likely to achieve remission with benralizumab. Analyses of the BORA and MELTEMI extension studies showed that in the longer term, once remission is achieved with benralizumab, patients are likely to remain in remission with continued treatment. In the open-label, single-arm ANDHI-In Practice and PONENTE studies, patients achieving remission had a shorter median time since asthma diagnosis, higher median age at asthma onset and lower median ACQ-6 scores. The SHAMAL study and the Phase 3b ANDHI-In Practice substudy demonstrate that remission is maintained with benralizumab even when patients reduce their background medication. Finally, the XALOC-1 real-world study highlights how patients with lower BMI are more likely to achieve remission with benralizumab. These findings demonstrate that achieving remission in patients with SEA is feasible with benralizumab and, in turn, inform future directions for research and treatment that includes a promising shift towards a new era of treat-to-target.

The item mean score and the overall mean score for the responses were calculated. The 300 respondents participated in the study we got a 100% response rate. The majority were male (55.3%) and were Saudi residents (94.3%). Most respondents rated their understanding of medicolegal complications regarding preoperative radiographs as fair (35.3%), while 19.3% rated it as poor. Only 62.4% viewed preoperative radiographs as very or extremely important in preventing malpractice claims, and 63.7% considered them crucial evidence in legal disputes. Additionally, 65% felt that fear of malpractice influences unnecessary radiographs, and 75.0% agreed that patient education could reduce malpractice risks. Notably, 85.7% had not received formal training on the legal implications of radiographs, highlighting an educational gap. Confidence in justifying radiographic practices to legal professionals varied, with 58.4% reporting moderate to high confidence, while 54.7% felt uncomfortable defending the decision not to take radiographs when typically recommended. Many dentists lack sufficient knowledge and confidence about pertinent legal principles, even if they acknowledge the importance of preoperative radiographs in lowering malpractice claims and acting as legal proof. This study underscores the pressing need for improved training, policy development, and ethical standards to address the gaps in the medicolegal understanding of radiographic practices among dentists in Saudi Arabia. The integration of medicolegal education into dental training is essential for equipping dental professionals to navigate their legal responsibilities effectively. How to cite this article: Jaha H.

Selected 100 primary molars were randomly divided into two groups, group A (EXF) and group B (TNC). Teeth were clinically evaluated using United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Bulk-fill composite showed marginal disintegration compared to short fiber-reinforced composite (SFRC). No significant difference was observed for other parameters evaluated under USPHS criteria at different follow-up periods except for marginal adaptation favoring the SFRC at 3 and 6 months. This study supports SRFC as a preferable material choice over bulk-fill composite resin, offering valuable guidance to dental professionals in clinical decision-making. Incorporation of short glass fibers in Ever X Flow enhances marginal adaptability and minimizes microleakage at restorative margins.

Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar and whisker-like structures have been realized by modulating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the deposition process. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. In this work, we first successfully achieved precise control over cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating the anodic interface and optimizing the deposition pressure, while demonstrated kinetic-driven morphology evolution and substrate-engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, not only completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal but also providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.",

In immunostaining of the brains of IH mice, TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus were significantly reduced compared to RA mice. Furthermore, in the brains of mice with decreased TH-positive neurons induced by IH, the expression of hippocampal neurons has not been affected. In the analysis of glial cells, in IH group mice, a significant increase of microglia was found in the substantia nigra, VTA, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus compared to the RA mice. These findings suggest that there is a loss of TH-containing neurons and neuronal inflammation in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus under chronic IH. Our findings provide precise evidence for the loss of TH-containing neurons in the setting of chronic IH mouse models, which can provide relevant empirical observations for clinicians.",

      "content": "Biliary strictures (BS) remain frequent after pediatric liver transplantation (pLT) and best management practices are still lacking. This study systematically assesses efficacy of stricture treatment by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage (PTCD). Online databases were searched for studies on PTCD treatment of BS after pLT from the year 2000 to 2024. Efficacy and safety profile of PTCD were analyzed. Influence of various risk factors on outcome parameters was compared by meta-regression. Twenty-seven observational studies with 802 patients undergoing PTCD for BS met the inclusion criteria. Incidence of BS was 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.3-16.1) in 6543 patients reported who underwent pLT between 1989 and 2020. Overall efficacy of PTCD to achieve stricture resolution was 78.3% (95% CI: 66.5-80.4). Drainage duration longer or shorter than 109.1 days did not impact on achievement of resolution with efficacies of 76.5% (95% CI: 65.4-86.2) in short versus 75.1% (95% CI: 61.9-86.5, p = 0.87) in long drainage. Overall recurrence rate after stricture resolution was 16.0% (95% CI: 7.5-26.3). Drainage duration longer or shorter than 109.1 days did not affect recurrence rate which was 17.4% (95% CI: 3.3-37.3) in short versus 20.9% (95% CI: 14.0-28.5, p = 0.68) in long drainage duration. Overall rate of procedure-related complications was 9.9% (95% CI: 2.6-20.0, p = 0.99) and was not influenced by drainage duration. PTCD is efficient to treat BS after pLT. Drainage time does not impact efficacy, recurrence rate, and complication rate.",

      "content": "This study included 82 individuals, who presented with maxillary impacted canines. Assessment of impaction included type, location, alpha angle, and distance \"<i>d</i>\". Sagittal skeletal patterns were evaluated by measurement of sella, nasion, point A (SNA), sella, nasion, and point B (SNB), anteroposterior relationship between A-point and B-point (ANB), A point to nasion perpendicular to Frankfort horizontal, and Pogonion to nasion perpendicular to Frankfort horizontal. Three angles were used to analyze VSPs (SN-MP, FH-MP, and MM angle). Cephalometric measurements were processed using OnyxCeph3TM software. Associations between impaction type, location, and skeletal patterns, as well as the relationship between impaction type, location, and impaction-related variables (alpha angle and distance <i>d</i>) were all measured. Correlations were established between impaction-related variables and skeletal measurements. Class III sagittal skeletal pattern was the most frequent (41.5%), while normodivergent vertical skeletal pattern (VSP) was predominant (53.6%). Bilateral impactions were associated with lower mean SNA and SNB angle measurements compared with unilateral impactions. A significant positive correlation was found between the alpha angle and distance <i>d.</i> No statistical association was observed between impaction-related variables and skeletal patterns. A prognathic maxilla and hyperdivergent skeletal patterns were less frequently associated with maxillary impacted canines. Both jaws exhibited greater retrusion in bilateral cases compared with unilateral maxillary impacted canines. Although certain trends in skeletal patterns were noted, these patterns are not directly associated with maxillary impacted canines and, therefore, lack predictive reliability. Skeletal analysis alone may not reliably predict impactions, which supports the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach that can guide orthodontic treatment for maxillary impacted canines in Yemeni adults.

Data were analyzed using the Chi-square (χ²) test to determine statistical significance. Molars were the most examined teeth (37.0%), followed by premolars (25.5%), canines (22.5%), and incisors (15.0%). Enamel lamellae were mostly grade II (43.3%) with no significant variation by age (<i>p</i> = 0.261) or tooth type (<i>p</i> = 0.653). Type A enamel lamellae (91.5%) did not differ significantly by tooth type (<i>p</i> = 0.237) or age (<i>p</i> = 0.871). The extent was primarily type E2 (72.0%) with no significant differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Enamel tufts were mostly type M1/3 (71.5%) with no age (<i>p</i> = 0.313) or tooth type association (<i>p</i> = 0.413). Enamel spindles (79%) increased with age (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and with tooth type (<i>p</i> = 0.029). Interglobular dentin (77.5%) increased significantly with age (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but not tooth type (<i>p</i> = 0.871). GAP type was the most common CEJ type (55.5%) with significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The study concluded that enamel lamellae and tufts showed no significant variation with age or tooth type. Enamel spindles increased with age and tooth type, while interglobular dentin increased with age but not tooth type. The most common CEJ type was GAP, with significant differences observed. Understanding the histological characteristics of enamel lamellae, tufts, and incremental lines in different teeth and age-groups is crucial in endodontics, as these structural variations influence crack propagation, fracture resistance, and treatment outcomes. Age-related changes affect dentin permeability, irrigation efficiency, and obturation success. These advancements play a crucial role in improving restorative and endodontic approaches for enamel preservation and regeneration. How to cite this article: Gupta S, Bathla S, Astekar M.

      "content": "By providing an additional layer of epigenetic regulation beyond the canonical genetic code, these complexes significantly influence bone biology and health. Epigenetic regulation through chromatin remodeling complexes is crucial in modulating gene expression and cellular behavior in bone cells. However, alterations in the activity of chromatin remodeling complexes can also contribute to the progression of various bone diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that specific chromatin remodeling factors may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing bone‑related conditions and as therapeutic targets for intervention. The present review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between chromatin remodeling complexes and bone‑related diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and osteosarcoma. The present review discusses the diverse subunits of these complexes and their multifaceted roles in regulating key cellular processes such as stemness, differentiation, proliferation, senescence and apoptosis in bone cells. Notably, the present review provides a comprehensive overview of the roles of various chromatin remodeling subunits, such as BRG1, BAF47 and chromodomain‑helicase‑DNA binding 7 (CHD7), in bone metabolism, highlighting their disease‑specific mechanisms, including bromodomain‑containing protein (BRD)9‑mediated pyroptosis in intervertebral disc degeneration and CHD7‑driven bone‑fat imbalance. Furthermore, the present review highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting dysfunctional subunits (such as BRD7 in osteosarcoma and SS18 in synovial sarcoma) and propose AI‑driven structural biology approaches to design chemical modulators. The understudied impact of aging on chromatin remodeling activity in bone homeostasis is also underscored, advocating for longitudinal studies to address this gap. Finally, the distinct functions of each chromatin remodeling complex and its specific subunits in the context of bone‑related diseases were also explored, providing a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to both normal bone physiology and pathological conditions.",

The present study aimed to investigate the genetic etiology of OI in a family and the pathogenicity of the splice‑site variant. Whole‑exome sequencing was performed for the proband and Sanger sequencing was performed for all family members to validate the results. Reverse transcription (RT)‑PCR on lymphocyte strains was performed on the proband and an age‑matched control, and minigene experiments were performed to verify the splicing patterns. A heterozygous variant, c.3531+1G>T, was detected in <i>COL1A1</i> in all patients in the family. RT‑PCR showed an increase in abnormal transcript expression and a decrease in normal transcript expression in the proband. Minigene splicing assays revealed that the mutant gene exhibited four splicing patterns, whereas the normal gene exhibited three splicing patterns. This finding indicated that the c.3531+1G>T variant site affected intron 47 splicing. To the best of our knowledge, this variant was first reported in the Palestinian population, whereas the present study is the first to report this variant in the Chinese population and to clarify the effect of this variant. The results expand the spectrum of pathogenic variants associated with OI.",

      "content": "Iron supplementation for individuals who have ascended rapidly to high altitudes can effectively mitigate the phenomenon of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; however, the precise role and detailed mechanisms remain to be determined. The present study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of iron in acute hypoxia‑induced lung injury. Sprague‑Dawley rats were initially placed in a hypobaric hypoxia chamber for various durations to determine the optimal time for acute hypoxia‑induced lung injury. The rats were exposed to a hypobaric hypoxia chamber for 3 days, during which they were treated with an iron chelator or iron sucrose. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was measured to assess hypoxic pulmonary vascular response. Furthermore, the degree of lung injury was assessed by calculating the pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio, and via morphological evaluation of lung tissues and the pulmonary vasculature. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were performed to assess hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression and mitophagy levels. Edu and Cell Counting Kit 8 assays were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation under acute hypoxia. In addition, immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the expression levels of proteins associated with cell apoptosis and mitophagy. The results indicated that mitophagy (LC3B‑II/LC3B‑I expression), pulmonary edema (lung wet/dry weight ratio) and lung injury score were most significant after 3 days of hypoxia. However, mitophagy (LC3B‑II/LC3B‑I ratio) and lung injury scores peaked after 4 weeks of hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, an iron chelator was observed to promote pulmonary edema, elevate mPAP and cause lung injury. Conversely, iron sucrose was shown to attenuate lung injury in acute hypoxia. The mechanistic findings indicated that acute hypoxia induced HIF1α activation and increased mitophagy, which promoted a reduction in proliferation and an increase in the apoptosis of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Furthermore, the iron chelator promoted, whereas iron sucrose ameliorated, the abnormal alterations in pulmonary artery endothelial cells under acute hypoxia. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that a reduction in iron bioavailability in acute hypoxia may promote HIF1α activation and increased mitophagy, which in turn has been linked to the development of pulmonary edema, elevated mPAP and lung injury. The administration of iron supplementation may be considered an effective method for the alleviation of the aforementioned abnormalities resulting from acute hypoxia.",

      "content": "Rotavirus infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. The viral surface proteins VP4 and VP7 are each classified into multiple genotypes (P[1]-P[58] for VP4 and G1-G42 for VP7), which differ in their susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies; however, detailed analyses of these differences remain limited. This study investigates the susceptibility of diverse VP4 and VP7 genotypes to neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination or natural infection. A reverse genetics system based on the human rotavirus Odelia strain (G4P[8]) was used to create monoreassortant viruses by replacing the VP4 or VP7 genes with those from clinical isolates (obtained in Thailand) or prototype strains. We generated 11 VP4 and 19 VP7 reassortants, covering 7 and 17 genotypes, respectively. Neutralization tests using the monoreassortant viruses, immune sera, and MA104 cells indicate that the VP7 genotype, rather than the VP4 genotype, primarily influences susceptibility to neutralization. Furthermore, genotypes G2, bat-like G3, G11, G12, G25, and G33 were significantly less susceptible to sera from naturally infected Thai individuals, highlighting the importance of monitoring these genotypes. To identify the protein region responsible for susceptibility to neutralization, we generated chimeric viruses by exchanging the domains of high- and low-susceptibility VP7 genotypes and found that Domain I appears to play a substantial role in determining susceptibility. Thus, we identified multiple rotavirus genotypes with reduced susceptibility to neutralization, as well as the region primarily responsible for this reduction. These findings may help to predict possible future rotavirus outbreaks in humans and facilitate the development of effective rotavirus vaccines. IMPORTANCERotavirus, the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants, is responsible for approximately 128,500 infant deaths globally each year.",

      "content": "Single-target and traditional multi-target therapies, derived from individual drugs, show limited efficacy in addressing these interconnected events, due to spatiotemporal heterogeneity of action in single-target components. This highlights the urgent need for not only new therapeutic targets, but advanced multi-target drugs. Herein, we identify elevated cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a key neuroinflammatory driver, as correlated with SAH severity and poor prognosis, suggesting its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, a novel \"in situ proliferation\" strategy is proposed and a flexible multi-target peptide nanoparticle is developed through co-assembling matrix metalloproteinase-2 responsive cationic peptide and glutathione peroxidase-mimicking peptide (GPXP). Upon reaching injury lesions, this system splits into two individual drugs: cationic peptide scavenges pathological cfDNA and inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, while GPXP protects neurons against oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis/ferroptosis. Consequently, this strategy proves superior therapeutic effects on reducing secondary brain injury and promoting neurofunctional recovery in SAH mice. These findings not only highlight the essential role of cfDNA in SAH but offer a flexible resolution to advance multi-target combinational therapy.",

Verification of the reliability of results using multiple sensitivity analysis methods. The results of forward MR analysis revealed a statistically significant positive causal relationship between allergic asthma (AA) and frailty, as well as between atopic dermatitis (AD) and frailty; however, no causal effects were detected between allergic conjunctivitis (AC), allergic rhinitis (AR) and frailty. The results of reverse MR analysis indicated that frailty had a statistically significant positive causal effect with AD and AR, but no causal effect with AA or AC. The sensitivity analysis showed that the MR results were stable, with no heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. This study found a bidirectional causal relationship between AD and frailty, a positive causal relationship between AA and frailty, an inverse causal relationship between AR and frailty, and no causal relationship between AC and frailty. In view of this, it may be recommended to promote routine frailty screening among patients with AD and AR to help identify high-risk individuals early. Additionally, appropriate interventions for frailty are crucial to reduce the risk of AA and AD.",

      "content": "Small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) are noncoding RNAs involved in the maturation of U-rich small nuclear RNAs. Except for a few that have their own transcription units, most scaRNA genes are embedded in introns and are predicted to be transcribed with host genes. Herein, we report that scaRNA28 is the first scaRNA with a dual synthesis pathway, and that this RNA is transcribed in an independent transcription unit (ITU) by RNA polymerase II while located in intron 2 of the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) gene. We evaluated the scaRNA28 synthesis pathway using minigenes containing exon 2, intron 2, and exon 3 of <i>TRRAP</i>. A minigene with a mutation preventing 5' splicing recognition of the exon 2/intron 2 junction generated scaRNA28, suggesting a pathway processing unspliced transcripts into scaRNA28. Even promoterless minigenes and DNA fragments with regions from exons 2 to 3 of <i>TRRAP</i> showed RNA polymerase II-dependent synthesis of scaRNA28, indicating a novel synthesis pathway involving an ITU. Linker-scanning mutational analysis revealed that the promoter region required for scaRNA28 expression in the ITU is located within 60 bases including exon 2/intron 2 junction of <i>TRRAP</i>, and especially the first two bases of intron 2 region, a putative part of the MYC-binding (E-box) motif, are essential for scaRNA28 expression in the ITU. MYC promotes scaRNA28 expression by binding to the promoter region in the ITU.",

By constructing atomically engineered Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S nanowires (NWs) via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% for ethanol at -0.95 V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high-performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag-based systems is achieved.

      "content": "The different shape-morphing behaviors of hydrogels in various phenols are related to the degree of phase transition and the elastic modulus. Phenols with a phenolic OH number less than or equal to 3 (such as phenol, gallic acid, and ethyl gallate) diffuse uniformly into the hydrogel network, resulting in hydrogel bending due to the heterogeneous phase transition of the network at both sides. In contrast, phenols with a phenolic OH group number greater than 3 (such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin, and tannic acid (TA)) interact strongly with the hydrogel network, causing the network at both sides to undergo the same phase transition and a larger elastic modulus, which leads to shrinkage without bending of the hydrogel. Moreover, P(NIPAM-<i>co</i>-AAm) hydrogels exhibit reversible and irreversible responsive characteristics in EGCG and TA solutions, respectively. We demonstrate the applications of phenol-induced phase transitions in P(NIPAM-<i>co</i>-AAm) hydrogels for phenolic-responsive grippers, shape reprogramming of hydrogel, and erasable information displays. The results provide useful insights to understand the interaction between phenols and PNIPAM hydrogels, thus shining light on their applications in soft robots, sensors, and information storage.",

      "content": "A control group of patients undergoing RIRS without laser use were used for comparison. Urine samples were collected at 3 time points as follows: preoperative, 1 hour postoperative, and 10 days postoperative. Samples were analyzed using ELISA for key biomarkers-kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and β2-microglobulin-normalized to urine creatinine. Primary outcome was the extent of renal injury based on biomarker elevation. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Ninety-one patients with similar baseline patient and stone characteristics were randomized (46 TFL, 45 Ho:YAG). Both lasers led to significant biomarker elevation, which trended toward but did not reach baseline by postoperative day 10. The Ho:YAG laser resulted in a sustained increase in NGAL at 10 days. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that injury is dose dependent on total laser energy used (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and worse in older patients (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and in those with metabolic syndrome (<i>p</i> = 0.002), with slower recovery in both these groups, but not with the type of laser used. Multiple levels of the nephron are involved. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> There is notable kidney injury induced by both SuperPulse TFL and pulse-modulated Ho:YAG lasers in a dose-dependent manner, but the 2 lasers do not differ in the degree of injury. Injury occurs at multiple levels. Age and metabolic syndrome affect the amount of injury and recovery from injury. Further studies evaluating factors that can mitigate damage from high-energy lasers are needed.",

      "content": "To study these complex systems, researchers are increasingly gathering intensive longitudinal data (ILD), revealing non-linear phenomena such as asymptotic growth, mean-level switching, and regulatory oscillations. However, psychological researchers currently lack advanced statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture these non-linear processes accurately, which hinders theory development. While methods such as local polynomial regression, Gaussian processes and generalized additive models (GAMs) exist outside of psychology, they are rarely applied within the field because they have not yet been reviewed accessibly and evaluated within the context of ILD. To address this important gap, this article introduces these three methods for an applied psychological audience. We further conducted a simulation study, which demonstrates that all three methods infer non-linear processes that have been found in ILD more accurately than polynomial regression. Particularly, GAMs closely captured the underlying processes, performing almost as well as the data-generating parametric models. Finally, we illustrate how GAMs can be applied to explore idiographic processes and identify potential phenomena in ILD. This comprehensive analysis empowers psychological researchers to model non-linear processes accurately and select a method that aligns with their data and research goals.",

Using PacBio HiFi long reads and Omni-C proximity ligation sequencing, we produced an improved, haplotype-phased assembly (v4.0) for TAG0014, an early-generation selection of E. grandis. The two haplotypes are 571 Mbp (HAP1) and 552 Mbp (HAP2) in size and consist of 37 and 46 contigs scaffolded onto 11 chromosomes (contig N50 of 28.9 and 16.7 Mbp), respectively. These haplotype assemblies are 70 to 90 Mbp smaller than the diploid v2.0 assembly but capture all except one of the 22 telomeres, suggesting that substantial redundant sequence was included in the previous assembly. A total of 35,929 (HAP1) and 35,583 (HAP2) gene models were annotated, of which 438 and 472 contain long introns (>10 kbp) in gene models previously (v2.0) identified as multiple smaller genes. These and other improvements have increased gene annotation completeness levels from 93.8% to 99.4% in the v4.0 assembly. We found that 6,493 and 6,346 genes are within tandem duplicate arrays (HAP1 and HAP2, respectively, 18.4% and 17.8% of the total) and >43.8% of the haplotype assemblies consists of repeat elements. Analysis of synteny between the haplotypes and the E. grandis v2.0 reference genome revealed extensive regions of collinearity, but also some major rearrangements, and provided a preview of population and pan-genome variation in the species.",

      "content": "Designing Co-free LRMO can further leverage the low cost of this class of cathodes given the capacity can be maintained. However, implementing cobalt-free LRMO cathode materials are hampered by their sluggish kinetics, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance that underperform compared with their Co-containing counterparts. Here, it is confirmed that the slow kinetics of Co-free LRMO originates from the structural disorder caused by transition metals (TMs) migration at high voltages (above 4.5 V Vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) and consequent irreversible oxygen redox process. Aware of this, Na<sup>+</sup>/F<sup>-</sup> is introduced in surficial lattice to alleviate these issues, ultimately achieving improved discharge voltage (≈0.2 V above 1 C, 1 C = 0.25 A g<sup>-1</sup>), exceptional cycle stability in pouch-type cell (95.1% capacity retention in 1 C after 400 cycles at 25 °C, and 80.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles in 0.5 C at 45 °C) and excellent C-rate performance (≈150 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 5 C). The newly developed Na<sup>+</sup>/F<sup>-</sup> gradient design unleashes the surficial charge transfer kinetics limitation and greatly improves the lattice structure stability, consequently providing valuable guidelines for future high-capacity LRMO cathode design.",

      "content": "The three isoforms, SIK1, SIK2, and SIK3, compose a subfamily of the AMPK-related kinases. The SIKs have multiple conserved protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites by which they are regulated. Further, a family of well-characterized SIK targets is the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs), which promote CREB transcription. As such, the SIKs participate in several cAMP-dependent pathways, including classical GPCR cascades characteristic of endocrine signaling. This review discusses the currently known roles of the SIKs in the endocrine system. Specifically, the research on SIKs in this field up to this point has focused on the adrenal glands, ovary, pancreas, pineal gland, immune function of the thymus, parathyroid hormone signaling in the bone, and hypothalamic regulation of the circadian rhythm and endocrine axes. Further, this review highlights the remaining questions in these areas and the glands in which little to no SIK research has been published: the testis, pituitary, thyroid gland, and parathyroid glands.",

However, GPP's low incidence and limited evidence represents a challenge in determining its real-world efficacy. This review aims to explore the clinical use of spesolimab in a real-world setting. We conducted a review on PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect of case series and reports of patients with GPP treated with spesolimab. Review articles and clinical trials were excluded. A total of 62 patients with GPP were included. Age ranged from 4 to 88 years. A total of 48 reported comorbidities of which 30 patients had plaque psoriasis. Spesolimab 900 mg IV was administered in 1 to 4 doses. Follow-up periods ranged from 2 weeks to 15 months. Complete GPP remission was observed in 35 (56.4%, 35/62) patients, 21 of them achieving it within a week. Partial remission was defined in 27 (43.5%) patients. GPP recurrence after treatment was observed in seven patients. After spesolimab administration, plaque psoriasis recurrence was reported in six (20%, 6/30) patients, three (10%, 3/30) reported improvement, and 21 (70%, 21/30) didn't report information about their outcome. Eight patients reported adverse effects including laboratory abnormalities, infections, and erythema multiforme. Spesolimab demonstrates a low prevalence of adverse events and clinical efficacy for GPP treatment including patients with comorbidities, infections, and over 75 years of age. Its effect on plaque psoriasis remains unclear.",
