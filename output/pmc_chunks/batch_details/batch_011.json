      "content": "In addition to their well-known involvement in several enzymatic reactions, recent discoveries revealed their participation in other processes, e.g. in gene expression via epigenetic processes, including biotinylation of proteins in the case of biotin. Plants, fungi, archaea and most bacteria synthesize both vitamins, whereas animals and humans lack enzymes for their biosynthesis and depend on their exogenous supply. At least in case of biotin, human gastrointestinal microbiota can likely partly satisfy the need. Both vitamins are water soluble and require a transporter for efficient absorption after oral administration; they can be rapidly excreted, hence being considered largely non-toxic. In addition to physiological and kinetic aspects of vitamins B<sub>6</sub> and biotin, this review, which is based on a search in PubMed up to 2023, covers sources of these vitamins, the impact of food treatment on their content, causes and symptoms of deficiency and specific mutations related to their function. Currently available literature on the analytical determination of these vitamins in biological fluids, possible pharmacological uses, and symptoms of toxicity, although rare, are also included.",

Feature distributions across sleep stages and transitions, the Arousability Index, and sleep cycles were systematically analyzed. To evaluate their potential for automated applications, a pilot bi-LSTM framework was employed, with min-max scaling applied to improve neural network training. The ability of ORP and SS to characterize sleep architecture was also explored through their capacity to predict the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), a key indicator of sleep quality. Both ORP and SS showed strong correlations with the gold-standard hypnogram. ORP excelled in binary Awake/Asleep classification, whereas SS demonstrated superior resolution of transitional stages and alignment with traditional sleep cycles. SS also outperformed ORP in automated sleep staging for unseen datasets, exhibiting higher generalizability and robustness. Additionally, SS proved more effective than ORP in predicting AHI and showed significant differences across Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity levels. ORP and SS offer complementary strengths for continuous sleep depth assessment. ORP provides precise binary classification suitable for clinical diagnostics, while SS's robust generalizability and alignment with sleep dynamics present transformative potential for automated applications.",

Beyond their culinary appeal, microgreens are gaining recognition as nutrient-dense functional foods due to their high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolics, compared to mature greens and sprouts. Unlike sprouts, which are harvested after 2-7 days, microgreens are harvested between 7 and 21 days after the development of young true leaves, offering enhanced microbial safety. Among them, herb microgreens such as fenugreek, basil, mustard, fennel, coriander, and moringa stand out for their rich bioactive composition and potential therapeutic benefits. Their health-promoting properties include anti-hyperglycemic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and roles in immune modulation, cardiovascular health, and managing age-related diseases. As a result, their demand is increasing in both the food and pharmaceutical industries.

      "content": "This review focuses on the key distinctions in PFAS exposure between the occupational population and the general population from different countries. A systematic summary is made from the external exposure environment, exposure pathways, internal exposure levels, and health effects of the occupational population. The manufacturing, use, and disposal processes of PFAS increase their concentration levels in the ambient environment, leading to significantly higher concentrations than background areas. Different PFAS exposure pathways may lead to different molecular initiating events and health outcomes in the occupational population and the general population. Moreover, the PFAS exposure levels of the occupational population are nearly one hundred times higher than those of the general population. Mixed exposure to more unknown PFAS is another important feature of the occupational population. Although occupational exposure to PFAS is not associated with mortality, PFAS exposure can significantly disrupt metabolic pathways and cause adverse effects on the liver, kidney, and lipid homeostasis. Therefore, more stringent occupational protections for the PFAS occupational population are necessary to reduce their health risks.",

      "content": "P2-Na<sub>0.67</sub>Ni<sub>0.33</sub>Mn<sub>0.67</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is regarded as a viable cathode material for sodium ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density. However, it also has challenges that impair its electrochemical performance, like the P2-O2 phase transition, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion effect, and the Na<sup>+</sup>/vacancy ordering at high voltage. Here, an approach is proposed to use the Cu/Li binary doping modification of P2-Na<sub>0.67</sub>Ni<sub>0.33</sub>Mn<sub>0.67</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which stabilizes the cathode structure by introducing Li into alkali metal sites and Cu at transition metal sites. Due to its anti-site doping, Li acts as an interlayer stationary point that suppresses the relative slip of the TMO<sub>2</sub> layer under high pressure and produces a solid solution reaction that is nearly zero phase transition. The assembled full-cell devices with Na<sub>0.67</sub>Li<sub>0.1</sub>Ni<sub>0.18</sub>Cu<sub>0.05</sub>Mn<sub>0.67</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode and commercial hard carbon anode can deliver a high energy density of 379.3 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, due to the proposed unique dual-site doping, the full-cell also exhibits excellent cycling stability, which maintains a capacity retention rate of 84% and 71% over 200 and 1000 cycles at 1 C and 10 C, respectively.",

Among these modifications, 5'-O-P-N phosphoramide nucleotides represent an emerging class of nucleotide analogs featuring a phosphoramidate (P-N) linkage at the 5'-hydroxyl position. This structural alteration significantly influences their chemical reactivity, enzymatic stability, and biological function, making them valuable tools for drug design, nucleotide-based enzymatic studies, and synthetic biology applications. In this review, we explore the synthetic methodologies employed for constructing 5'-O-P-N linkages, including phosphoramidation strategies, catalytic approaches, and emerging green chemistry techniques. Additionally, this study discusses the biological implications of these modifications, focusing on their role in nucleotide metabolism, enzyme interactions, and potential as antiviral and anticancer agents.",

The resultant NaA zeolites enhance surface area and more structural defects compared to those produced by hydrothermal methods. The electron paramagnetic resonance study demonstrates that the microplasma anode can generate a hundred times more hydroxyl free radicals (·OH) than the microplasma cathode, thereby expediting the zeolite crystallization process. The density function theory calculations also suggest that the abundant ·OH radicals will lower the free energy barrier with the cooperative effect to accelerate the synthesis. The NaA zeolites demonstrate superior performance as adsorbents for heavy metal ions, boasting higher adsorption capacities and exceptional stability when compared with those prepared hydrothermally. Additionally, they serve as excellent supports of cobalt catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, achieving low CH<sub>4</sub> conversion rates and a high olefin/paraffin ratio in C<sub>2-4</sub> products. With its operational simplicity, accessible equipment, rapid synthesis capabilities, and enhanced material properties, MIPEC stands out as a highly promising technique for the efficient production of zeolites, underscoring its extensive potential for widespread applications.",

Across the entire sample, heightened maltreatment experiences were associated with reduced epistemic trust and increased epistemic mistrust, both of which significantly contributed to more severe parental burnout. Importantly, while epistemic mistrust served as a significant mediator for both mothers and fathers, epistemic credulity emerged as a significant mediator exclusively for mothers. These findings highlight the intricate pathways through which childhood maltreatment experiences can exacerbate parental burnout. From a clinical perspective, the results underscore the need to address distortions in epistemic trust to mitigate parental burnout among parents with histories of childhood maltreatment. Moreover, these findings underscore the need for awareness campaigns designed to reduce parents' hesitation to seek assistance-potentially rooted in their own experiences of childhood maltreatment and epistemic stances-and to enhance public understanding of parental burnout.",

The Family MUAC approach, which trains caregivers to measure their children's MUAC and refer them for treatment, has shown promise, but evidence regarding its impact on malnutrition severity at admission is limited. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal study from March to May 2024 in two districts in Eastern Ethiopia, enrolling 360 children aged 6-59 months. We compared children referred by their mothers or caregivers using the Family MUAC (n = 180) with those referred by Health Extension Workers (HEWs) (n = 180). We found that the median MUAC at admission was 119 mm (IQR 116-120) in the mother-referral group versus 116 mm (IQR 115-119) in the HEWs-referral group, and the proportion of severe acute malnutrition (MUAC < 115 mm) was lower among caregiver-referred children (4.2% vs. 18.4%). Multivariable regression analysis showed that mother/caregiver-referred children had an 80.5% lower risk of severe MUAC at admission [ARR 0.195(0.06, 0.59)] and a 75% reduced likelihood of SAM admission compared to the HEWs-Referral group (ARR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.148-0.448). The Family MUAC approach significantly reduced the severity of malnutrition at admission.",

This systematic literature review and network meta-analysis compares the safety outcomes of B/F/TAF with other ART regimens in TN PWH, addressing a key aspect of therapeutic decision-making. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A systematic literature review was performed to identify phase III and IV RCTs assessing B/F/TAF and comparator regimens in TN adults (≥18 years) with HIV-1. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL databases were last searched on 14 June 2023. Study design, population and outcome definitions were evaluated to ensure consistency across studies. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted where feasible, following key methodological guidelines. <b>Results:</b> Nineteen studies were included in indirect comparisons following assessments of heterogeneity and network connectivity. B/F/TAF performed better than the majority of interventions in safety and tolerability outcomes, notably discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs and nausea. Additionally, with comparable risk of experiencing grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs, diarrhea and all-cause discontinuation rates to other interventions, B/F/TAF was non-inferior to any other regimen for all outcomes. B/F/TAF typically outperformed interventions containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor third agents in terms of treatment-related AEs, nausea, and discontinuation due to AEs, although treatment class effects were not estimated separately. <b>Conclusion:</b> This analysis highlights the favorable safety profile of B/F/TAF compared with other ART regimens in TN PWH, demonstrating that B/F/TAF remains a safe and well-tolerated ART option for most TN PWH.",

      "content": "Dyslipidemia, a modifiable risk factor for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), is prevalent among individuals with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The coexistence of DM and dyslipidemia exacerbates the burden of CVDs. Given the variability in findings across systematic reviews, this umbrella review aims to assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia among diabetic patients critically. A systematic search was performed across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify meta-analyses addressing the prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients with DM. Studies were selected in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Meta-analyses that provided data on the prevalence or mean difference of lipid profile components in diabetic patients were included. To evaluate study quality, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) frameworks were applied, ensuring the reliability and consistency of the findings. Eleven meta-analyses with a total sample size ranging from 433 to 354,088 participants were included. The prevalence of overall dyslipidemia varied between 60% and 65.68%. Specific lipid abnormalities were also prevalent: high total cholesterol (34.7-38.6%), elevated triglycerides (43-52.7%), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (34.4-41%), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (43.4-50%). Gender differences were insignificant, with a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia among women compared to men, particularly after menopause (19% vs. 18%). Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among diabetic patients, with significant gender- specific patterns, particularly affecting postmenopausal women. These findings highlight the importance of early screening and targeted management of lipid abnormalities in DM patients to reduce the risk of vascular complications.",

Two female cases with incidental mediastinal masses were retrospectively analysed, focusing on multimodal presentations. For both cases, CT studies showed well-defined, low-density oval masses in the right anterior superior mediastinum with the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) invasion. Intralesional punctate calcifications were observed in Case 2. MRI revealed hypointense masses on T1WI and slightly hyperintense on T2WI, with partial diffusion restriction on DWI. Case 1 had mild enhancement, while Case 2 had significant enhancement. PET-CT showed significant FDG uptake with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 9.2 and 5.1, respectively. Both patients underwent surgical resection, with pathology confirming mediastinal EHEs. Mediastinal EHE presents as a well-defined soft-tissue mass with punctate calcifications and heterogeneous enhancement, typically located in the anterior mediastinum with invasion into medium or large veins. Moreover, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal tumors.",

      "content": "MicroRNAs have emerged as pivotal post-transcriptional regulators, orchestrating a myriad of cellular processes critical to both normal physiology and pathological conditions, par-ticularly cancer. Among these, miRNAs containing the highly conserved AAAGUGC seed se-quence have garnered significant attention due to their multifaceted roles in cancer progression, acting as both oncogenes and tumour suppressors across a wide spectrum of malignancies. This review delves deeply into the evolutionary significance of AAAGUGC seed-containing miRNAs, elucidating their conserved nature and intricate roles in the regulation of cancer-related gene ex-pression networks. We focused on eight specific miRNAs- miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-519d-3p, miR-526b-3p, and miR-20b-5p -each of which demonstrates con-text-dependent oncogenic or tumour-suppressive behaviour. Through an in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which these miRNAs modulate critical pathways, we highlighted their capacity to influence essential processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and drug resistance, reflecting the complexity of their regulatory roles. Furthermore, we dissected the intricate interactions between these miRNAs and their downstream targets, showcasing their diverse contributions to the tumour microenvironment. The implications of miRNA dysregulation in chemotherapy resistance were also explored. In conclusion, AAAGUGC seed-containing miRNAs represent a complex and evolutionarily conserved family with implications in cancer biology. Their ability to modulate multiple onco-genic and tumour-suppressive pathways highlights their potential as therapeutic targets or bi-omarkers in the context of personalized cancer treatment strategies.",

      "content": "Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs exhibit exonuclease resistance, prolonged antigen expression, and increased activation of innate immune receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that circRNA-based vaccines encoding tumor-specific neoantigens effectively stimulate Antigen- Presenting Cells (APCs), particularly Dendritic Cells (DCs), leading to robust CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) activation. This results in increased cytokine production, T-cell proliferation, and durable anti-tumor immunity. Compared to conventional neoantigen vaccine platforms, circRNA vaccines offer distinct advantages, including higher immunogenicity, improved cytosolic delivery, and minimal risk of genomic integration. CircRNA vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical tumor models, with studies highlighting their ability to induce long-term memory T-- cell responses and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. However, challenges remain in optimizing circRNA delivery, mitigating unintended immune activation, and scaling up manufacturing processes. The translational potential of circRNA vaccines in tumor immunotherapy is significant, offering a novel and scalable approach to personalized cancer treatment. Further research and clinical validation are needed to optimize their design, improve manufacturing efficiency, and assess their efficacy in human trials. CircRNA vaccines represent a next-- generation platform with the potential to revolutionize cancer immunotherapy by harnessing durable and targeted anti-tumor immune responses.",

More importantly, such photoisomerization suppresses the charge transfer processes in favor of resonance energy transfer pathways instead. The demonstrated ability to shift between multiple relaxation pathways (e.g., charge transfer, energy transfer, or photoluminescence) as a function of the excitation wavelength resulted in photoswitch-directed tailoring of model phosphinylation reaction outcomes. Thus, incorporating spiropyran moieties within the framework allows for visible light to be harvested and funneled toward either a ligand-based reactive center or an acceptor molecule such as a photochromic unit. Moreover, the framework's chemical activity was promoted exclusively by organic linkers without the participation of metal nodes, the addition of (co)catalysts, or the use of harsh conditions at room temperature. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of stimulus-responsive platforms, for which chemical activity could be controlled through a photochromic moiety.",

      "content": "Glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) are key controllers of carbohydrate metabolism due to their roles in promoting glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, respectively. However, the coordinated responses of GS, GP and glucose transporters (GLUTs) in the liver and gill to changes in salinity remain unresolved. In this study, we initially subjected Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) to unidirectional transfers, either from fresh water (FW) to seawater (SW) or from SW to FW. We then transferred FW- and SW-acclimated tilapia to a tidal regime (TR) where salinity alternated between FW and SW every 6 h. Our goal was to characterize how carbohydrate metabolism is affected by unidirectional and tidal changes in salinity. Whether fish were transferred from SW to FW in a unidirectional manner or to a TR, glucose levels increased after transfer to FW or during the FW phase of the TR (TF). Conversely, hepatic glycogen levels were higher in fish in SW and the SW phase of the TR (TS) than in TF. In both FW and TF, branchial expression of the gill-specific isoform of GP (gpg) was downregulated, while gs was upregulated. Branchial gpg was upregulated in fish unidirectionally transferred from FW to SW or sampled during TS. Hepatic gp and gs expression increased following transfer from SW to FW. Thus, we consistently found that increases in salinity promoted branchial glycogen breakdown, while decreases in salinity led to hyperglycaemia. Moreover, while branchial glucose transporter 1 (glut 1) expression was downregulated after transfer from FW to SW, glut1 was transiently upregulated in the liver. In both liver and gill, glut1 expression was higher in fish in TF compared to TS. Gill filament explants incubated with cortisol exhibited reduced glut1 expression regardless of medium osmolality. Our collective data indicate that salinity differentially regulates hepatic and branchial carbohydrate metabolism.",

Data on natalizumab (NTZ) effectiveness in people with MS (PwMS) based on race/ethnicity are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of NTZ on relapse onset and rate, and to assess MS-related healthcare encounters and costs in Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White PwMS. This was a retrospective analysis of the Komodo Health Claims Database, including adult patients in the US with one or more MS claim at index date (January 1, 2016-August 31, 2022). Patients were followed from first NTZ exposure through end of study, end of insurance eligibility, gap in index DMT > 45 days, or DMT switch. Annualized relapse rate (ARR), time to first relapse, and MS-related healthcare encounters and costs were compared in the 12 months pre/post NTZ initiation and while on treatment across racial strata. The study included 3244 PwMS (Black, n = 632; Hispanic, n = 382; Asian, n = 49; White, n = 2181). Mean post-index NTZ exposure was 15.5-19.2 months. Post-index ARRs were significantly reduced across racial/ethnic groups (p < 0.001). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimated proportion of relapse-free patients at 2 years for all racial/ethnic groups was not significantly different from the White group. Significant differences were observed in annualized MS-related healthcare cost rates but not in annualized MS-related encounter rates before and after NTZ initiation across the racial/ethnic groups.",

Perceived benefit determined trust and medical adherence among participants. Findings revealed that being Black immigrant and legal requirements such as proof of legal status fueled perceived susceptibility. To counter their susceptibility and earn trust from providers, participants were pressured to present themselves in an 'acceptable' manner in healthcare settings. Self-efficacy was demonstrated through self-research on their cases and self-advocacy. Cues to action included seeking second opinions and changing providers depending on availability. Healthcare systems should prioritize billing transparency, effective communication, equitable practices, and legal protections for immigrants.

Following melatonin treatment, intracellular iron, ROS, and 4-HNE levels were significantly reduced. Additionally, the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system xc<sup>-</sup>) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were increased, and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) was diminished. APP, β-site-APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), presenilin 1 (PS1) and Aβ production were alleviated in erastin-treated SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, melatonin effectively inhibits ferroptosis-related cell death and AD-like conditions induced by erastin in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lines.",

Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The synergy index was applied to evaluate whether the combined effect of both types of discrimination was greater than their individual effects. Workplace discrimination was associated with a higher risk of sleep disturbances (adjusted RR = 1.50 [1.09, 2.06]). Everyday discrimination also increased the risk of sleep disturbances (adjusted RR= 1.38 [1.00, 1.93]). The joint effect of workplace and everyday discrimination was associated with a higher risk of sleep disturbances (adjusted RR = 1.78 [1.16, 2.72]), with synergy index suggesting an additive interaction. Both workplace and everyday discrimination independently affect sleep quality, with an additive interaction between the two. The double burden of workplace and everyday discrimination can significantly impact sleep disturbances. Further research is needed to explore the biological mechanisms linking discrimination and sleep disturbances.",

Multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) has emerged as a promising adjunct, providing real-time assessment of neural integrity to identify and address intraoperative compromise. This study seeks to rigorously assess the diagnostic accuracy of IONM in ACDF, evaluate its predictive utility for postoperative neurological outcomes, and analyze its association with intraoperative neural events. This monocentric retrospective observational study analyzed CDH patients who underwent ACDF between 2014 and 2023. Neurological status was pre- and postoperatively assessed and compared to IONM data, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and electromyography (EMG) alarms. IONM diagnostic performance was analyzed using confusion matrices and ROC curves on the binary variables. Multivariate logistic regression was implemented to identify predictors of postoperative neurological decline. SSEPs and MEPs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with ROC curve areas improving significantly from preoperative (T0) to postoperative (T1) assessments (SSEP AUC: 0.922 to 1.000; MEP AUC: 0.915 to 0.996, p < 0.01). Among 442 consecutive patients, 38 (9%) intraoperative IONM alerts were recognized, labeled as transient, sustained single-modality, or sustained dual-modality changes. Permanent neurological injuries correlated with alert severity. Intraoperative alarms were the strongest predictor of postoperative motor deficits (OR:14.0, p < 0.01). Multimodal IONM demonstrated significant predictive value for postoperative neurological outcomes in ACDF, with intraoperative alerts strongly correlating with motor deficits. IONM was associated with postoperative neurological outcomes, suggesting a potential role in selected high-risk patients. Further studies are warranted to assess cost-effectiveness and define standardized indications.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they investigated patients with vasospasm post-aSAH treated with both BA and IA CCBs. Eight studies met inclusion criteria, comprising patients treated with BA, IA nimodipine, or IA verapamil. Combined BA with IA nimodipine significantly improved clinical outcomes compared to BA alone (OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.68, p = 0.02) without increasing hemorrhagic or ischemic risks. However, ischemic complications were higher with combined therapy than IA nimodipine alone (OR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.40, p < 0.01). Combined therapy reduced retreatment rates compared to IA verapamil monotherapy (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.15-8.79, p = 0.03). Our analysis indicates that combined BA and IA CCBs may improve clinical outcomes for aSAH patients with vasospasm without increasing complications compared to BA alone. However, combined therapy was associated with a significant increase in ischemic complications compared to CCB monotherapy. These findings highlight the potential role of combined therapy in select patients unresponsive to single-agent approaches and emphasize the importance of careful patient selection. Further randomized studies are necessary to confirm these findings and establish standardized guidelines for combined therapy use.",

      "content": "Although EVT achieves high rates of large-vessel reperfusion, clinical outcomes are significantly influenced by underlying comorbidities. Chronic hypertension impairs collateral circulation and increases the risk of cerebral edema and mortality. Diabetes mellitus is associated with reduced functional recovery and heightened hemorrhagic risk. Atrial fibrillation often leads to larger infarcts and contributes to higher unadjusted mortality. Chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with dialysis dependence, predicts poor neurological outcomes and increased procedural complications. Active malignancy substantially elevates mortality, especially in patients with metastatic disease. Systemic comorbidities are important modifiers of outcome after EVT. While technical success rates routinely exceed 80-90%, functional recovery and survival vary significantly across patient subgroups. Meta-analyses and registry data highlight that comorbidities independently increase the risk of futile recanalization, complications, and mortality. EVT remains appropriate for medically complex patients, but optimal results require comorbidity-informed risk stratification and multidisciplinary, goal-concordant care.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and an electronic search was conducted to identify all studies comparing outcomes between the two techniques. Change in Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) was the primary outcome. Adverse events, duration to maximum response, and latency to first response were secondary outcomes. A total of 384 patients with 2657 injections for HFS patients and 1033 injections for BEB patients were reported across six studies. The mean difference analysis for the change in JRS scores in HFS patients reveals a statistically significant difference favouring the pretarsal group for improved JRS ratings (MD=0.47, CI= 0.19 to 0.75, P = 0.001) and change in JRS scores in BEB patients favouring the pretarsal group (MD=0.92, CI= 0.48 to 1.36, P 0.001). There was a significant difference favouring the pretarsal group in duration of maximum response in HFS (P= 0.0005) and fewer occurrences of ptosis (P=0.0009). Other secondary outcomes including post-procedure tearing, irritation, and lagophthalmos had similar results. Pretarsal botulinum toxin injection is a preferable alternative for BEB and HFS compared to the preseptal approach, because it minimizes the extent and frequency of spasms, has less occurrences of ptosis, and has a greater duration of maximal response. More clinical trials are needed to validate the findings of this meta-analysis. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Within those 56 articles, 38 COAs were identified across all studies, including different versions of the same COA as separate measures. Of these 38 COAs, 24 were PerfOs and 7 were PROs. The most used COAs did not differentiate recovery from compensation. However, 3 COAs were identified as able to discriminate recovery from compensation. Studies on FES and exoskeletons in SCI have precedent to examine therapeutic effects using a variety of functional COAs. Clinical trials in SCI would benefit from COAs with interval scales that assess therapeutic effects that differentiate between recovery and compensation.",

This study was conducted in Center for Traumatology and Rehabilitation, Brussels (Belgium). We included eighteen (n = 18) participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), scored according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI). Backward and forward translation of SCIM III was performed. Each participant was scored for the translated SCIM III and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) by three physicians. We evaluate the internal consistency, the intra- and inter-reliability, the validity and the sensitivity to change with Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Kappa coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Pearson's correlation, paired t-test and McNemar test. For the validity, we compared SCIM III scores with those of the FIM. The French SCIM III (frSCIM III) provided excellent internal consistency. Kappa values for inter-reliability were all above 0.60, except for 3 items, and were statistically significant. We found a strong correlation between raters. All the tests showed a very good intra-reliability. frSCIM III and FIM showed very good correlation. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity to change between the frSCIM III and the FIM. The frSCIM III proved to be a consistent, reliable, and valid scale for clinical use. It is the first functional assessment scale validated in French for people with SCI.",

This review focuses on the mechanisms, efficacy, and clinical applications of VED and PTT in post-RP patients. VED, a well-established, non-invasive modality, enhances penile blood flow, preserves tissue integrity, and facilitates early engagement in sexual activity. Although VED has been shown to help maintain penile length and improve sexual function, its effectiveness in accelerating spontaneous erectile function recovery remains uncertain. PTT, originally developed for Peyronie's disease, has recently been explored for post-RP patients. Preliminary studies suggest its potential in mitigating penile shortening and supporting functional recovery, though long-term efficacy data remain limited. Both therapies face challenges, including lack of standardized protocols, adherence issues, and encouraging, but limited evidence on their combined use with pharmacological interventions. Additionally, factors such as patient education, treatment accessibility, and psychological support play critical roles in therapy adherence and overall success. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols, improve patient compliance, and establish the role of VED and PTT in comprehensive post-RP care through large-scale, well-designed clinical trials.",

      "content": "We recruited 145 older adults (age ≥ 60): 102 recently remitted LLD participants and 43 healthy comparisons. Participants underwent baseline MRI and evaluation of depression symptoms/status for up to 2 years. We evaluated intrinsic network connectivity for 111 participants (39 healthy comparisons, 47 stable remitted, 25 relapsed). Compared to healthy comparisons, LLD participants had lower connectivity within the somatomotor network and greater connectivity between the executive control and default mode networks (DMN). Lower connectivity of DMN to somatomotor and salience networks was associated with relapse. Overall, connectivity of relapse participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than connectivity of stable remitted participants was. We found robust differences in network functional connectivity between stable remitted and relapsed participants. We also found evidence of neural \"scarring,\" or persistent functional network differences at baseline in all participants with a history of depression. Alterations in DMN connectivity were observed most prominently. Notably, the network structure of relapsed participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than stable remitted participants. These findings indicate that remission is associated with persistent functional network alterations while vulnerability to relapse is associated with a failure to establish a new stable homeostatic functional network structure.",

In Colombia, data regarding the effectiveness and safety of this procedure are lacking. This descriptive, retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent ESG between January 2022 and July 2023. Demographic and clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed. Changes in weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and percentage of Total Body Weight Loss (%TBWL) at 1, 3, and 6 months were assessed. Ninety patients were included in this study. The median baseline weight was 85.5 kg, and the median BMI was 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Weight reduction was observed after 3 and 6 months, with weights of 73 kg and 69.5 kg, respectively (p < 0.001). %TBWL increased to 8.3%, 15.5%, and 20.0% at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.001). BMI decreased to 27.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the third month and 25.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the sixth month, respectively (p < 0.001). Complications were mostly minor, occurring within the first month of follow-up, and included abdominal pain (21.1%), nausea (28.9%), vomiting (14.4%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms including heartburn and regurgitation (10%). Gastrointestinal bleeding (3.3%) was less common. ESG is a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for obesity. This study showed significant BMI and %TBWL reduction at the 3- and 6-months post-procedure follow-ups, with a low incidence of minor complications.",

Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine if Zn supplementation might effectively reduce hepatic lesions induced by OLZ. The oxidative stress, inflammatory, and fibrotic indicators of the liver tissues were evaluated, and electrophoretic methods were used to analyze the native protein and isoenzyme patterns. Furthermore, the liver tissues were examined histopathologically. The dynamic motion of the extracted hemoglobin was also examined. In addition to the serious damage identified histopathologically, our results show that OLZ treatment altered the liver tissue's antioxidant and inflammatory indicators. The zinc sulfate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) salt solution, given in a dose-dependent fashion, reduced these changes. Additionally, the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> salt solution enhanced the natural protein, lipid, and calcium moieties of the protein pattern that were electrophoretically detected and changed by OLZ. In terms of the isoenzyme patterns, the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> salt solution reduced the electrophoretic catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), and β-esterase (β-EST) isoenzyme patterns that were hampered by OLZ in a dose-dependent manner. Rats treated with OLZ in addition to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> showed an increase in heme-heme interactions, suggesting that zinc therapy stabilized oxyhemoglobin. This promotes a more effective folding process that improves the use of oxygen. A dosage of 100 mg/kg of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was shown to normalize physiological, histological, and biochemical markers. It also improved interactions between heme molecules.",

While most previous studies have focused on single-metal neurotoxicity, the mechanisms underlying combined manganese and iron exposure remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of manganese and iron exposure, both individually and in combination, on tau hyperphosphorylation, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation (particularly Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>), apoptosis, and the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in PC12 cells. Our results demonstrated that both manganese and iron significantly increased GSK-3β expression and decreased β-catenin and c-Myc levels, indicating inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Although both metals enhanced tau hyperphosphorylation, APP amyloidogenic processing via increased BACE1 expression, and accumulation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, manganese exposure predominantly exacerbated tau hyperphosphorylation, whereas iron preferentially promoted amyloidogenesis.",

This meta-analysis included 13 studies with 37,633 Japanese AF patients comparing underdose and standard dose groups. Efficacy outcomes included stroke or systemic embolism and ischemic stroke. Safety outcomes were major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, all bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analyses evaluated robustness by including studies with confounder controls. Underdosing showed similar risks of stroke or systemic embolism (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.22) and ischemic stroke (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85-1.31) compared to standard dosing. Major bleeding (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.72-1.04) and all bleeding (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63-1.03) showed a non-significant reduction with underdosing. Sensitivity analyses confirmed a significant reduction in major bleeding risk with underdosing (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.94). All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the underdose group throughout the primary (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90) and sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, Japanese patients receiving an underdose of DOACs had thromboembolic event rates comparable to those seen with standard dosing, with a reduction in bleeding events confirmed by sensitivity analyses and higher mortality. These findings indicate that ethnic-specific factors may influence DOAC effects, warranting further investigation to validate these observations and inform tailored dosing recommendations for Japanese AF patients.",

We found that photoreceptor layer thickness decreased with age in all participants, while retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer thickness decreased only in those with apparently healthy macula (P < 0.05). Higher PRS was associated with thinner photoreceptor and RPE layer thickness, larger drusen size and presence of soft drusen.

To identify potential therapeutic candidates, we conducted a drug screening analysis using an angiosarcoma cell line, HAMON. Cancer-related gene analysis revealed alterations in FGFR4, MYCN, CDKN2A, NF1, TP53, KDM6A, ATRX, MSH6, ATM, and NOTCH1 in HAMON cells. Screening of 4681 FDA-approved drugs identified four candidate compounds, with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib selected for further study. ATP and MTT assays revealed bortezomib to be the most effective candidate against HAMON cells. Clonogenic assays revealed fewer HAMON cell colonies in the range of 1-10 nM bortezomib. DNA-content fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed a notable increase in the sub-G0/G1 phases, suggesting cell death without cell cycle arrest. Annexin V-propidium iodide staining revealed a significant increase in the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells in the bortezomib group. Mechanistically, bortezomib induced activation of NF-κB and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling. The administration of bortezomib to immunocompromised mice implanted with HAMON cells induced apoptosis of tumor cells. This study identified the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as a potential candidate for angiosarcoma in vitro and in vivo.",

      "content": "However, this growth often focuses on cost-driven strategies like generic drug production rather than innovation. Challenges such as fragmented regulatory systems, limited infrastructure, low R&D budgets, and dependence on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) limit global competitiveness in drug innovation. R&D investment in these markets rarely exceeds 5% of revenue, compared to 20% in established markets, widening the innovation gap. Advanced technologies such as physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual bioequivalence studies present opportunities to overcome these barriers. These tools streamline drug development, lower costs, and improve regulatory processes. For instance, a case study on generic donepezil showed that a $150,000 investment in PBPK modeling software could yield returns of 113.7% when clinical studies are required and 1,120% if a biowaiver is granted. These results demonstrate the financial and operational advantages of adopting innovative technologies, enabling faster market entry and scalability across portfolios. By embracing advanced tools, companies in emerging markets can align with global regulatory trends, enhance sustainability through resource efficiency, and improve access to affordable medicines. This approach bridges the gap between economic growth and technological leadership, fostering global competitiveness and contributing to public health advancements.",

Conventionally, research on RTT has concentrated on the neurological impact of MECP2 mutations. However, other evidence suggests that the influence of RTT extends beyond neural boundaries, impacting a broad spectrum of other tissues and organ systems. This chapter provides an overview of identified abnormalities in respiratory, skeletal, cardiac, liver, endocrine, urinary, immune, and gastrointestinal systems in patients with RTT or related disease models. We further explore the potential pathways involved in the brain-body circuit and their impact on the development of RTT. These insights not only enhance our understanding of the multi-system involvement in RTT, but also reveal the necessity for a more comprehensive approach to investigating the systemic courses of neurological disorders.",

The evolution of the gut microbiota throughout an individual's life-from early developmental influences like birth mode and antibiotic use to changes associated with aging and neurodegenerative conditions-highlights its dynamic nature. The chapter reviews experimental approaches and microbiome-based interventions to demonstrate the influence of gut microbiota on neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it emphasises the importance of advancing microbiome-targeted therapies, integrating emerging technologies, and clinical trials to develop personalised strategies for enhancing brain health through gut microbiome modulation.",

      "content": "Most energy in the brain is consumed to support synaptic neurotransmission, which is the primary means of neuron-to-neuron communication between. This energy is in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and within neural cells, nearly all ATP is produced by mitochondria via the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To ensure that ATP is readily available, mitochondria are trafficked to areas of greater energy use, such as neuronal synapses. The balance between energetic supply and synaptic communication is essential for proper brain functioning. This chapter begins with a brief introduction to key features of neuronal synapses and mitochondrial energy production in the cerebral cortex. Next, the tight and bidirectional coupling of neuronal synaptic activity and mitochondrial OXPHOS is examined from functional, ultrastructural, and molecular perspectives. The effects of brain and non-brain organ system perturbations on synaptic-mitochondrial coupling are then examined within the context of (1) primary brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (2) primary peripheral disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. Finally, a discussion of potential intervention strategies that may restore neural communication and mitochondrial bioenergetics, within the framework of the brain-body connection, is provided.",

The activation of IGF1R regulates several downstream pathways, predominantly mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In the body, IGF1 is primarily secreted by hepatocytes and transported in the bloodstream to act as a driver of growth, protein anabolism, and feedback for the action of growth hormone (GH). In the brain, IGF1 is produced by several cell types, and it is a regulator of several systems, exerting its action on neurogenesis, modulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity, and regulation of brain states. IGF1 concentration needs to be finely regulated, since its deficits or overexpression can have detrimental and potentially lethal effects. In addition, IGF1 plays an important role in pathologies including cancer, metabolic diseases, stroke, and brain disorders. IGF1 is one of the few molecules whose transport between the brain and body is regulated by a specialized mechanism present in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Considering that IGF1 is produced in both brain and body, it is not clear why IGF1 needs to be transported in the brain from the body. We propose that IGF1 acts as a connector to improve brain function in response to the body's metabolic states and other factors. Therefore, IGF1 transport from body to brain represents a strategy to coordinate the whole-body well-being.",

      "content": "In the central nervous system (CNS), NE acts as a neurotransmitter, primarily released by the locus coeruleus (LC), to regulate vigilance states and optimize behavioral performance. It is also the primary neurotransmitter of the peripheral, sympathetic nervous system, responsible for tonic and reflexive changes to cardiovascular tone. Conversely, Epi operates primarily as a hormone released by the adrenal medulla, to regulate metabolic homeostasis and orchestrate the body's response to acute stress. While there is no evidence for direct connections between the central and peripheral adrenergic systems, various feedforward and feedback circuits enable them to collaborate and synchronize brain-body responses to stimuli. A notable example of this interaction is evident in the body's response to stress, where multiple adrenergic systems work in concert to elicit a fight-or-flight response to perceived danger. Reciprocal communication between the LC, other adrenergic systems in the brain, and the NE-driven sympathetic nervous system induces a state of heightened arousal, enhances the processing of sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavioral responses to stressors. In this chapter, we will explore adrenergic systems in the brain and body and share evidence for multiple channels of communication between them. We will trace the anatomical connections and physiological characteristics of NE-producing neurons in the brain and the peripheral nervous system. We will also describe adrenergic systems in the body, projections of the sympathetic postganglionic neurons, the vasal ganglia of the cranial nerve, and release of NE and Epi by the adrenal medulla into the bloodstream. Importantly, this chapter will elucidate the circuits and pathways of communication between NE in the central and peripheral nervous systems that regulate and synchronize cognitive processes and physiological responses. Finally, we will explore various neurological disorders, including chronic pain and Alzheimer's disease (AD), that show evidence for deficits in adrenergic systems and disruption of the communication between the brain and body.",

Happiness and sleep quality from infancy to early adolescence were retrospectively reported by mothers. Prenatal psychosocial factors were recalled by mothers through a structured interview. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel modeling was conducted to analyze the data. Happiness and sleep quality trajectories differed significantly between U. S. adolescents in the HBBS and Chinese adolescents in the CJCC (P < 0.001). In both cohorts, cross-lagged effects showed consistent associations between happiness and subsequent sleep quality across the five time points (coefficients: 0.086-0.154, P < 0.01). The relationship between sleep quality and subsequent happiness was significant from 1-3 to 11 years. The bidirectional relationship was stronger in the Chinese cohort. Maternal prenatal psychosocial support positively predicted children's happiness (β = 0.072, P < 0.001) and sleep quality (β = 0.056, P < 0.001) trajectories. A bidirectional relationship exists between children's happiness and sleep quality, with potential cultural variations.

We show that microglia are mobilized ahead of invasion, transforming morphologically and functionally-first forming glial nets around tumor infiltrates and then organizing into 'oncostreams' guiding collective migration. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed three distinct states for tumor cells and microglia, corresponding to invasive niches versus tumor bulk. The invasive patterns and niche-specific gene signatures of tumor cells and TAMs were validated in human GBMs. We further identified a critical role of plexin-B2 in TAMs for resolving cell collision, aligning GBM cells and restructuring the extracellular matrix. Plexin-B2 ablation in TAMs disrupted invasion tracks, shifting GBM growth from infiltrative to bulk expansion. Understanding niche-specific TAM mobilization and anatomical-functional invasion units opens new strategies to target GBM invasion.",

The clinical data of patients with CIM treated between September 2019 and September 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. During the procedure, the splenic colon was used as a reference to restore the intestinal tube, the colon was released to the middle colon vein, the duodenum was released and exposed to become an abdominal organ, the mesentery root was widened, and the pancreas head to appendix root distance was measured. Thirty-seven patients underwent the programmed procedure (22 males and 15 females). The neonates' condition was stable and without strangulation obstruction. The median operating age was 6 (2-27) days, the weight was 2946.49 ± 346.11g, the midgut volvulus was 360-720°, the reset time was 10.49 ± 3.98 min, the pancreas head to appendix root distance was 5.44 ± 0.32 cm, and the operating time was 94.32 ± 17.64 min. No mesenteric vascular injury or conversion to laparotomy was recorded. The postoperative enteral nutrition support time was 10.30 ± 2.07 days. There were no recurrences or intestinal obstructions during a follow-up of 12 to 48 months. The programmed laparoscopic Ladd's surgical procedure based on abnormal anatomic landmarks for treating neonatal CIM could improve surgical safety, reduce subsidiary injury after grasping the key points, and result in quick recovery and aesthetic appearance.",

This study aims to evaluate the clinical application value of an electromagnetic tracking system in assisting with ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic one-step biliary fistulation (PTOBF) combined with rigid choledochoscopy for hepatolithiasis. The clinical data of 19 patients with hepatolithiasis were analyzed retrospectively. These patients underwent PTOBF combined with rigid choledochoscopy for the treatment of hepatolithiasis. A total of 19 cases of hepatolithiasis were successfully performed PTOBF combined with rigid choledochoscopy under tracheal intubation and general anesthesia. EMTS-assisted US-guided PTOBF was successfully completed in 18 patients, with a puncture success rate of 94.7% (18/19) and a dilatation success rate of 100.00% (19/19). Five cases percutaneous located in left bile duct while 14 cases in right bile duct, with an overall one-time puncture success rate of 84.2% (16/19). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 6.00 ± 2.63 mL, the mean puncture time was 43.79 ± 65.57 s, and the mean postoperative hospitalization was 4.63 ± 1.86 days. The rates of out-of-plane puncture were 73.7% (14/19), and the initial stone clearance rate was 68.42% (13/19). The incidence of postoperative complications was 10.52% (2/19), including one cases of pleural efusion and one case of bile leakage which recovered after treatment. During a mean follow-up period of 59.26 ± 12.91 days (range 35 to 77 days), no complications or deaths were observed. EMTS-assisted US guidance for PTOBF combined with rigid choledochoscopy appears to be a minimally invasive, safe, and effective method for the treatment of hepatolithiasis, offering clinical application value. Furthermore, the integration of EMTS and US simplifies and facilitates the operation.",

This study addresses unresolved questions related to changes in abdominal contour, rectus muscle behavior, and rehabilitation as part of an ongoing quality improvement initiative. Forty-five patients underwent a standardized eTEP repair for small ventral hernias with diastasis recti. Structured core training and electrostimulation were implemented postoperatively for the last 15 patients, while the first 30 received routine care. CT scans analyzed with the Ellipse 9 tool provided abdominal contour, eccentricity (c/a), semilunar line distance (X2), and rectus muscle width. Rectus muscle areas were measured pre- and postoperatively in 29 patients, and bulging during Valsalva was assessed in a subgroup of 17 patients. A mathematical formula for bulging was tested for its sensitivity and specificity. Postoperative bulging occurred in 11.1% of non-stressed and 23.5% of Valsalva CT scans. The last 15 patients showed no bulging under non-stressed conditions (0% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.067) and demonstrated a significant improvement in eccentricity (p = 0.035). Postoperatively, the distance between the lateral borders of the rectus muscles (X2) decreased while the width increased, suggesting a curvilinear configuration. Rectus muscle atrophy was more pronounced on the right side across the entire group (p < 0.05) but was reversed in the last 15 patients.",

      "content": "The seven patients included five males and two females. Six were premature (22-28 weeks) and one was full term (38 weeks). All seven presented with clinical findings of an acute intestinal episode between 1 day and 15 months of age. Abdominal radiographs showed a distended abdomen with a relative paucity of bowel gas in four, and in the other three, there were multiple loops of dilated gas-filled intestine. Pneumoperitoneum was present in two. Sonography confirmed the presence of a large amount of echogenic ascites in all seven. The intestinal wall appeared variably thickened or thinned, with increased echogenicity in all. The defect of the intestinal wall, due to perforation, was located on sonography in all seven and showed communication between the intestinal intraluminal fluid content and the echogenic ascites in all seven. Tiny echogenic bubbles of gas were noted passing from the intraluminal space into the peritoneal cavity in two. Pneumoperitoneum was also noted on sonography in four. At surgery, the defect in the intestinal wall was located in the small intestine in four and in the large intestine in three. This study illustrates seven young children in whom an intestinal defect, due to perforation, was correctly recognized on sonography preoperatively. Sonography proved more useful than the abdominal radiographs in documenting the presence of perforation. Pediatric radiologists should make the effort to search throughout the entire abdomen and pelvis for the presence of an intestinal wall defect due to perforation on sonography in neonates, infants, and young children with an acute abdominal episode, especially in the absence of pneumoperitoneum on plain radiographs and sonography. Its recognition preoperatively will facilitate a rapid diagnosis and will direct appropriate management.",

We report a case of a moyamoya syndrome from this unusual cause, in a young child.

We aim to review the published articles on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical efficacy, and Tegoprazan's safety profile. We conducted a comprehensive search of literature before August 2024. We reviewed all published articles, including pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, drug interactions, clinical efficacy, and safety of Tegoprazan. Multiple studies have exhibited promising gastric acid-suppressing effect of Tegoprazan by competing with H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase potassium-binding site. Compared to PPIs, Tegoprazan exhibits a more potent and durable acid-suppressive effect that remains unaffected by food intake or CYP2C19 gene polymorphism. Tegoprazan can be used to treat all gastric acid-related disorders, i.e., GERD, ulcer and H. pylori. Multiple clinical trials exhibited substantial acid-suppressing effects of Tegoprazan at 50, 100, and 200 mg doses (p < 0.001) and relatively lower levels of gastrin. The most reported adverse events for Tegoprazan are gastrointestinal disorders (2-4.9%) and headaches (1-4.9%) and can disappear spontaneously without medical intervention. Tegoprazan is a novel PCAB having well-documented tolerance and safety profile thus can be administered for gastric acid diseases. However, current research on Tegoprazan is limited and primarily focuses on Asian regions. This is insufficient; we hope future studies will shed more light on other ethnic groups.",

However, their potential as building blocks for designing new compounds in the condensed phase is largely unexplored. Developments in preparative mass spectrometry instrumentation have opened up a new research field focused on understanding the chemistry of well-defined gaseous fragment ions on surfaces. In this Review, we highlight the preparative potential of gaseous fragment ions for synthesizing new compounds in the condensed phase. We discuss factors affecting the selectivity of the observed reactivity of fragment ions, examine the effect of charge on reaction mechanisms, and introduce the unexpected reactivity of ions of the same polarity on surfaces in the absence of solvent molecules.",

Of the 77 neonates included in the study, 42 (55%) received teleneonatology consultations. Teleneonatology reduced time to goal temperature (mean ratio 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58, 0.99]). This was partially mediated by earlier transport team activation and more frequent initiation of passive cooling prior to transport team arrival.

Standardized QC processes are critical to ensure consistent product quality and safety. This paper focuses on key QC measures, including mycoplasma detection using validated commercial kits or in-house methods with on-site validation, endotoxin testing via Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) or Recombinant Factor C (rFC) assays with validated protocols to prevent matrix interference, vector copy number (VCN) quantification through validated qPCR or ddPCR techniques, and potency assessment through IFN-γ ELISA following antigenic stimulation. Emphasizing method validation and standardized testing, this work underscores the importance of robust QC strategies to ensure the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell therapies, with ongoing efforts dedicated to optimizing these processes. This workshop focuses on addressing the harmonization of some quality control (QC) measures required for the validation of academic CAR-T cell production :mycoplasma detection; endotoxin testing; vector copy number (VCN) quantification; potency testing and the use of surrogate markers, if applicable. Sterility testing and characterization/identity/purity assessments are not covered in this work.",

Substantial geographical variation in the prevalence, genetic characteristics and clinical behaviour of BrS exists. Improvements in the understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the condition have been made over the past 30 years, opening avenues for the discovery of diagnostic and management opportunities. In this Primer, we discuss the evolving epidemiology of BrS, the emerging genetic understanding of the condition, as well as its diagnosis and management. We summarize the major societal guideline recommendations pertaining to BrS and highlight the potential for technological advancements, such as digital health and machine learning, to improve patient care.",

Notably, monotherapy of oral ZSA-215 achieved complete tumor regression and long-term survival of mice in MC38 colon cancer model, which is superior to MSA-2. Furthermore, ZSA-215 exhibited excellent metabolic and chemical stability in vitro, high oral drug exposure (AUC = 23835.0 h·ng/mL) and bioavailability (<i>F</i> = 58%).

      "content": "However, it faces significant challenges, including environmental compatibility, scalability, and multifunctional integration. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel strategies to improve agricultural water use efficiency. Herein, natural polysaccharides sodium alginate (SA) and thermoresponsive hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) are selected as the matrix, with SA cross-linking with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enable rapid gelation and continuous production of shape-controllable spheres. Additionally, carbon black (CB) and urea are incorporated through physical doping and chemical interactions to enable solar energy collection and slow-release fertilization. The synergistic effect of the hygroscopic salt and porous matrix resulted in water uptake of 0.64-3.38 g g<sup>-1</sup> at 30-90% relative humidity. The photothermal of CB, combined with the low-temperature phase transition of HPC, facilitated low-temperature desorption and rapid solar-driven water release, achieving maximum desorption rate of 4.07 g g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Notably, as water was released from the material and the matrix degraded, urea was gradually discharged, with release of 224.6 ± 5.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> over 30 days, providing sustained support for crop growth. This innovative approach provides sustainable and geographically unconstrained solution for agricultural water management in arid regions.",

      "content": "Herein, a glow discharge N<sub>2</sub> plasma is used to etch the [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> group of the NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) framework by highly reactive nitrogen radicals (the catalyst named N<sub>2</sub>-NiCoFe-PBA). Abundant CN vacancies (V<sub>CN</sub>) generated by this etching effectively suppress the Fe loss from N<sub>2</sub>-NiCoFe-PBA, while the lack of V<sub>CN</sub> results in the Fe leaching from the NiCoFe-PBA precursor during the anodic process. Consequently, N<sub>2</sub>-NiCoFe-PBA and NiCoFe-PBA are transformed into real active phases of NiCoFeOOH and NiCoOOH during the OER process, respectively. Theoretical calculations display that NiCoFeOOH has superior adsorption capacity toward OH<sup>-</sup> over Cl<sup>-</sup> to NiCoOOH, which is beneficial to excellent OER activity and anticorrosion performance in alkaline seawaters. In alkaline simulated and natural seawater, N<sub>2</sub>-NiCoFe-PBA exhibits much better OER performance with smaller η<sub>100</sub> (293 and 323 mV) than NiCoFe-PBA (405 and 434 mV). N<sub>2</sub>-NiCoFe-PBA can run stably over 110 h in an alkaline high-salty electrolyte (1 M KOH + 2.0 M NaCl) at 250 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. This study provides a modification method without destroying the structure to develop efficient and stable OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.",

      "content": "The OMFFE device consists of a focusing channel, an orthogonal separation channel, and two sets of voltage-controlled electrodes. In the scan voltage mode, the voltage and deflection angle are positively correlated for proteins, allowing the determination of the separation voltage for the target protein. In the selective voltage mode, proteins with a specific mass-to-charge ratio could be deflected into a specific channel, enabling selective separation of proteins. When the 75 V voltage was applied, the optimal resolution of the device between HAPs (human serum albumin, HSA, and immunoglobulin IgG) and LAP (green fluorescent protein, GFP) was achieved with Rs = 0.37. The OMFFE device achieved a removal rate of 94.7 ± 4.1% for HSA and IgG and a recovery rate of 95.3 ± 3.7% for GFP. The purity of GFP has increased by approximately 32 times. Furthermore, in human plasma, the removal rates of HAPs (HSA and IgG) and the recovery rates of LAP (GFP) are as high as 83.2 ± 3.9 and 76.3 ± 7.5%, respectively. The OMFFE device can achieve the removal and purification of proteins, hence posing promising potential in proteomics, protein function analysis, and medical diagnostics.",

Primary endpoints were the average aboBoNT-A dose received per treatment cycle and average interval between cycles. ResultsFor the 108 patients included, the median (Q1, Q3) age was 52.5 (41.0, 69.0) years and the most common underlying neurological condition was stroke (61.1%). The mean (SD) total dose of aboBoNT-A received was 540.8 (268.5) U (cycle 1), 586.1 (279.4) U (cycle 2), 558.0 (258.5) U (cycle 3), and 464.3 (209.6) U (cycle 4). The mean (SD) interval between cycles was 153.8 (56.9) days. Of 82 goals assessed, 71 (86.6%) were achieved. Seven patients (5.8%) in the safety population (<i>N </i>= 121) experienced adverse events, none of which were considered related to aboBoNT-A treatment. ConclusionsThese data further document aboBoNT-A as an effective and well-tolerated treatment for adult focal spasticity, supporting use in clinical practice.",

We retrospectively analyzed patients with PC who underwent surgery at 13 high-volume centers between January 2009 and December 2018. Inclusion criteria were: 1) cytology results of AUS, SFM, or malignant (MAL); 2) resectable (R) or borderline resectable (BR); 3) no other macroscopic metastases; and 4) no preoperative therapy. A total of 239 cases were included (AUS: 58, SFM: 31, MAL: 150), with R/BR = 196/43. Survival curves for SFM closely resembled those for MAL but differed from AUS. Grouped analysis showed that SFM + MAL patients had significantly shorter median overall survival (OS) than AUS patients (19.6 vs. 28.0 months, HR 1.61, P < 0.01) and shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS: 8.0 vs. 12.7 months, HR 1.53, P = 0.01). This trend persisted in resectable cases (OS: 21.1 vs. 30.5 months, HR 1.74; RFS: 9.1 vs. 14.2 months, HR 1.57; all P < 0.01). The cytology of SFM in PC is associated with a prognosis comparable to that of MAL, suggesting the need for cautious clinical interpretation and potential reclassification.",

Compared with the first tertile of preoperative GDF-15 concentrations, the second tertile had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.91; P=0.013), and the third tertile had an aOR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.30-0.64; P<0.001) for PONV. Restricted cubic splines showed that PONV odds decreased rapidly until the preoperative GDF-15 concentrations were 830.36 pg ml<sup>-1</sup> and then plateaued (P for overall <0.001, P for non-linearity=0.002).

Lower preoperative plasma GDF-15 concentrations or low-maintaining trajectory were associated with higher odds of PONV in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery patients.",

      "content": "Since the majority of the dose is delivered postoperatively with no deformation, the dosimetry approved at the time of implant may not accurately represent the dose delivered to the target and organs at risk. We aimed to evaluate the biological effect of the prostate deformation and its correlation with patient-reported outcomes. We prospectively acquired ultrasound images of the prostate pre- and postprobe cover inflation for 27 patients undergoing I-125 seed implant. The coordinates of implanted seeds from approved clinical plan were transferred to deformation-corrected prostate to simulate the actual dosimetry using a machine learning-based deformable image registration. The DVHs of both sets of plans were reduced to biologically effective dose (BED) distribution and subsequently to Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) metrics. The change in fourteen patient-reported rectal and urinary symptoms between pretreatment to 6 months post-op time points were correlated with the TCP and NTCP metrics using the area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR). Between the clinical and the deformation corrected research plans, the mean TCP decreased by 9.4% (p < 0.01), whereas mean NTCP of rectum decreased by 10.3% and that of urethra increased by 16.3%, respectively (p < 0.01). For the diarrhea symptom, the deformation corrected research plans showed AUC=0.75 and OR = 8.9 (1.3-58.8) for the threshold NTCP>20%, while the clinical plan showed AUC=0.56 and OR = 1.4 (0.2 to 9.0). For the symptom of urinary control, the deformation corrected research plans showed AUC = 0.70, OR = 6.9 (0.6 to 78.0) for the threshold of NTCP>15%, while the clinical plan showed AUC = 0.51 and no positive OR. Taking organ deformation into consideration, clinical brachytherapy plans showed worse tumor coverage, worse urethra sparing but better rectal sparing. The deformation corrected research plans showed a stronger correlation with the patient-reported outcome than the clinical plans for the symptoms of diarrhea and urinary control.",

However, variability in thresholds and timing highlights the need to explore PSA kinetics in real-world cohorts. This study investigates PSA dynamics and their predictors following Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors (ARSI) initiation. This multicenter study included mHSPC patients treated with ADT+ARSI between June 2017 and October 2024. Exclusions included ADT monotherapy, triplet therapy, or ARSI initiation >6 months post-ADT. PSA kinetics were analyzed over 12 months, focusing on SWOG (0.2-4 ng/ml) and TITAN (0.02-0.2 ng/ml) thresholds. Logistic regression and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis identified predictors of achieving low (<0.2 ng/ml) or ultralow (<0.02 ng/ml) PSA at 6 months. Among 586 mHSPC patients (median follow-up: 23 months), most had synchronous (58%), low-volume (58%), and ISUP grade 4-5 (64%) disease. At 6 months, 74%, 19%, and 7% achieved PSA <0.2 ng/ml, 0.2-4 ng/ml, and >4 ng/ml (SWOG cutoffs), while 36%, 35%, and 29% achieved PSA <0.02 ng/ml, 0.02-0.2 ng/ml, and >0.2 ng/ml (TITAN cutoffs). Baseline PSA <50 ng/ml and metachronous disease were strong predictors of ultralow PSA. SWOG and TITAN thresholds offer distinct PSA stratifications, with SWOG grouping more patients into the lowest PSA category and TITAN providing a more balanced distribution. Baseline PSA and metachronous disease are key predictors of favorable PSA responses, emphasizing their importance in guiding management.",

      "content": "This single-center retrospective study included immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infections presenting as focal, nodular lung lesion(s) on CT from 2012 to 2023. Thirteen clinical and CT semantic features were collected. Three-dimensional segmentation of the main lung lesion was performed on CT images, followed by radiomic feature extraction. The dataset was divided into training (80 %) and test (20 %) sets. Radiomic, clinical/semantic, and combined models were built using a multi-class random forest classifier and a 5-fold stratified cross-validation in the training set and tested in the test set. The performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). One hundred and ninety-six patients with aspergillosis (n = 123), tuberculosis (n = 41), or \"mucormycosis/nocardiosis\" (n = 32) were included. There were 131 men and 65 women with a median age of 67 years (age range: 20-95 years). The mean AUC of the radiomic model was 0.84 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.98), whereas the mean AUC of the clinical/semantic model was 0.66 [95 % CI: 0.46, 0.84]). The mean AUC of the combined model was similar to that of the radiomic model (0.82 [95 % CI: 0.63, 0.97]). The AUCs of the radiomic model (0.89 [95 % CI: 0.74, 1.00]) and of the combined models (0.93 [95 % CI: 0.83, 0.99]) for discriminating tuberculosis from the other two classes were significantly higher than the AUC of the clinical/semantic model (0.62 [95 % CI: 0.41, 0.81]) (P = 0.046 and 0.003, respectively). In our data set, the radiomic model performs better than a clinical/semantic model in differentiating tuberculosis from other nodular lung lesions. These encouraging results highlight the potential role of quantitative analysis in contributing to the diagnosis of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients.",

Therapeutic advances, such as the introduction of targeted therapies, and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of LMD now enable earlier diagnosis through dedicated MRI sequences and optimized CSF analysis. The EANO-ESMO classification notably distinguishes type I LMD (cytology-positive), which carries a worse prognosis but is more sensitive to intrathecal (IT) treatments, from type II LMD (negative or uncertain cytology), often more responsive to local-regional approaches like radiotherapy. Data from large retrospective cohorts highlight the importance of combination therapies: systemic treatments, IT injections, radiotherapy, as well as early symptomatic and palliative care. This multidisciplinary approach improves median survival, now reaching several months, and can even surpass 10 months in HER2+ cases. Innovative clinical trials, such as ETIC-LM (NCT05800275) - a French phase II study evaluating the combination of IT trastuzumab, oral tucatinib, and oral capecitabine offer encouraging new strategies for patient care. Although the prognosis remains poor, recent advancements suggest a more hopeful future, providing better disease control and improved quality of life for patients with LMD from breast cancer.",

      "content": "A total of 1658 families completed annual questionnaires for children aged 6-10 years, including children's weight, height and blood pressure as reported from paediatric visits. Age- and sex-specific z-scores of weight, height and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Mixed effects models were applied to assess differences for children conceived by any fertility treatment (n = 541), and by IVF/ICSI (n = 258) and ovulation induction and ICSI (n = 283) separately compared with children conceived without treatment (n = 968), adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors. Children conceived by any fertility treatment did not differ in anthropometry or blood pressure compared with children not conceived by treatment. Children conceived by ovulation induction and IUI were slightly smaller than children conceived without treatment in both weight-for-age (-0.19, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.03; P = 0.02) and height-for-age (-0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.08; P = 0.01) z-scores. Lower systolic blood pressure (-1.55 mmHg; 95% CI -3.02 to -0.07; P = 0.04) was also observed but not after accounting for height (P = 0.12). Children conceived by IVF/ICSI were similar in weight, height, BMI and blood pressure, but had slightly larger waist circumference (1.41 cm; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.46; P = 0.01). Children conceived by ovulation induction and IUI were slightly smaller in middle childhood than children not conceived by treatment but remained in the normal range of growth. Overall, these findings point to reassuring growth and blood pressure levels for children conceived by fertility treatments.",

      "content": "Here, we present a host cell line-engineering approach by removing nine Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) host cell hydrolases, which have previously been confirmed to degrade PS. Strikingly, the sequential genomic knockout (KO) of these hydrolases, including the genetic removal of two entire gene clusters of unprecedented size, yielded viable CHO host cell line variants. This novel host cell line was further optimized using the additional KO of the two key proapoptotic genes, Bax and Bak1. Thus, we generated a competitive multi-hydrolase KO CHO host cell line that was further shown to be highly suitable for the generation of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins. Most importantly, PS degradation and hydrolytic activity were drastically reduced, providing an avenue toward future PS degradation-free biologics-manufacturing processes.",
