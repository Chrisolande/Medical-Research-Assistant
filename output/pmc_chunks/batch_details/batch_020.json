      "content": "Typical imaging characteristics for HCC include non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), a washout appearance during the portal phase, and a defect in the Kupffer phase on CEUS using perflubutane microbubbles (Sonazoid). CEUS can show high diagnostic accuracy for HCC; however, we sometimes encounter challenging situations for diagnosing HCC. Some HCCs do not show APHE or the washout appearance, and other hepatic malignancies may exhibit similar imaging findings and be misdiagnosed as HCC. In addition, HCC needs to be differentiated from various types of hypervascular benign liver lesions. This review focuses on atypical imaging findings for HCC and typical imaging findings for common mimics of HCC as well as appropriate diagnostic workups for these lesions. Additionally, the literature review methodology, encompassing searches in PubMed, from January 1995 to January 2025, is briefly outlined. Clinicians need to carefully consider the histopathological features, imaging characteristics, and differential diagnoses of hypervascular liver lesions in order to prevent a misdiagnosis and select appropriate treatment plans. A detailed understanding of typical and atypical imaging features may prevent the false-positive diagnosis of HCC.",

      "content": "One of the major challenges in this field is the development of CPL emitters whose emission properties can be modulated by external stimuli, such as solvents. However, CPL-active materials are often synthetically demanding and typically require chiral separation. To address these limitations, we have synthesized a propeller-shaped molecule, (R/S)-Bz-6PDI 1, via a one-pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, using a chiral pyrrole-fused perylene diimide (PDI) 4 as the blade. The introduction of a chiral auxiliary into the blade enabled the induction of propeller chirality without the need for chiral chromatographic separation. (R)-Bz-6PDI 1 exhibited high CPL brightness in solution (BCPL = 103-369 M-1cm-1). Furthermore, the propeller chirality proved highly sensitive to the solvent environment, leading to significant modulation of both the sign and intensity of the CD and CPL signals, including complete signal inversion in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. CD spectral analysis combined with DFT calculations revealed that the propeller chirality is governed by the orientation of the hydrogen atom in the chiral auxiliary.",

      "content": "We surveyed African physicians for their perceptions of factors that impact negatively on optimal SLE care and interventions to improve care in Africa. MethodsA cross-sectional, online survey of African dermatologists, rheumatologists, nephrologists, and internists was conducted. ResultsResponses from 226 respondents mostly from West Africa and East Africa, majority practicing in university and state-funded hospitals showed that the commonest reasons for late diagnosis of SLE in Africa were lack of awareness of the disease amongst primary care doctors (92.4%), financial constraints (80.3%) and lack of access to health care (62.5%). Consulting traditional healers, the belief of bewitchment, lack of availability of diagnostic tests and concomitant chronic infections, (tuberculosis and HIV) were also perceived to have resulted in diagnostic delays, especially amongst East and West African respondents. The overwhelming majority (>90%) of respondents felt that increased health care and financial resources was the top priority to improving SLE care in Africa. Continuing medical education for generalists, training of specialists and patient education and awareness programs were considered less important interventions to improve SLE care. ConclusionThe study reveals that the primary reasons for late diagnosis of SLE in Africa are lack of awareness among primary healthcare doctors and financial constraints. Thus, the need for greater financial resources, especially for appropriate medications, medical education and improving patient understanding of the disease through support groups, to improve SLE care and outcomes in Africa.",

In this study, adzuki bean (V. angularis) cultivar 'Zhen Zhuhong' was grown hydroponically in 1/2 Hoagland nutrient solution with 0, 1, and 2 mg L<sup>-1</sup> cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>), and then treated with 0 or 1 μM BR at the V1 stage. Compared with Cd stress, ascorbic acid content, peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC1.15.1.1) activities in adzuki Cd-stressed bean roots under BR treatment were increased by 30.63%, 41.83%, 51.49%, and 29.48%, which alleviated intracellular ROS accumulation and DNA oxidative damage. In addition, proline content and free amino acid content in BR-treated adzuki bean seedling roots under Cd stress increased by 30.37% and 35.96%, which was conducive to maintaining cell membrane homeostasis and improving root activity. RNA-seq and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses revealed that BR treatment regulates the absorption, transport, and accumulation processes of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in adzuki bean seedling roots, reducing the nonspecific accumulation of Cd<sup>2+</sup> within cells and alleviating the toxic effects of Cd on root cells. BR treatment enhances the DNA damage repair in the roots of adzuki beans under Cd stress by reducing the extent of DNA oxidative damage, and effectively promoting the transition of cells from the G1 phase to the S phase.",

The methodological learnings of these studies showed that at-risk populations will provide valid data regarding sensitive or socially undesirable information with the goal of predicting emotions and behavior. However, there are significant participant, technical, and data challenges, as well as ethical considerations that face this nascent area of research that we synthesize for future projects. The lessons learned from these projects have important implications for prediction of anger, aggression, and violence in at-risk populations.",

Despite this, exactly how LRRK2 contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be determined, and definitive biomarkers to track LRRK2 function are still required. Such biomarkers can be useful for monitoring the pharmacodynamic response of LRRK2 therapeutics and/or understanding the relationship between LRRK2 and the clinical progression of PD. Moreover, biomarkers that can identify increased LRRK2 levels or activity beyond just carriers of pathogenic LRRK2 mutations will be important for expanding LRRK2 therapeutics to other PD populations. This review summarizes recent findings regarding biomarkers of LRRK2.",

Four themes emerged: (1) experiences with the WIC enrollment process, (2) less perceived stigma around WIC in comparison with other federal benefits, (3) challenges obtaining WIC-eligible items, and (4) infant feeding-related challenges. Findings are informing interventions that reduce WIC utilization barriers for Hispanic and Marshallese women in high need of assistance.",

This case series aims to promote reconsideration of ASD diagnoses in children with WHS and is the only report of ASD symptoms and confirmed diagnoses in WHS based on a comprehensive diagnostic assessment. Two children with WHS completed comprehensive clinical neuropsychological evaluations. Neurodevelopmental skills (Mullen Scales of Early Learning), adaptive behavior (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3rd Edition; Behavior Assessment System for Children-3rd Edition (BASC-3)), emotional and behavioral functioning (BASC-3), and ASD symptomatology (Childhood Autism Rating Scale-2nd Edition; TELE-ASD-PEDS) were assessed. Both children demonstrated multiple body system involvement consistent with typical medical complexities of WHS. Neuropsychological profiles of each patient revealed unique strengths and weaknesses, though each were consistent with diagnoses of intellectual developmental disorder and ASD. This case series demonstrates the need to comprehensively assess rather than merely screen ASD symptomatology in children with WHS, taking into account their degree of cognitive impairment. Increased awareness of this co-occurring diagnosis can help promote early identification by diagnosticians and monitoring by other medical providers caring for children with WHS, thereby enabling families to connect to appropriate intervention services.",

      "content": "Patient data from 196 individuals undergoing common CBCT procedures were collected. Effective and organ doses were estimated using VirtualDoseCT software. Lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence was estimated using BEIR VII report. DRL values were established based on gender and indication. Indication based values were 341 mGy.cm2 for implants, 387 mGy.cm2 for lesions, and 342 mGy.cm2 for sinus scans. Effective doses (EDs) were analyzed, yielding values of 30 μSv for males and 20 μSv for females. Organ doses analysis revealed that salivary glands received the highest dose, while thymus had the lowest in both genders. Lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence was evaluated and found to be 0.0027 in 100 000 for male patients and 0.0084 in 100 000 for female patients. The study highlights the importance of minimizing radiation exposure in CBCT examinations to reduce the risk of cancer and heritable effects. Tailored scan protocols and optimization measures can enhance patient safety by lowering doses. The results offer valuable guidance for dental and maxillofacial imaging practices on radiation doses and DRLs in CBCT examinations.",

Many studies indicate that developmental nutritional stress can permanently alter a suite of physiological, morphological, or behavioral traits, yet the phenotypic effects of low food supply in the environment may vary depending on the mode and degree of parental care. For example, our previous work suggests that zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) parents can buffer offspring from food restriction, minimizing negative effects on offspring growth, at the cost of maintaining their own body mass. To evaluate the effects of whole nest food restriction on the offspring further, we investigated short- and long-term changes in physiological and morphological traits of zebra finch young exposed to either an ad libitum diet or a 40% restricted diet as nestlings and juveniles until 60 days post-hatch.",

      "content": "Specifically, we measured furculum fat, the adrenocortical response, and glucose levels throughout development and into adulthood as well as body mass in adulthood to examine any latent or persistent effect. Young from the food-restricted nests overall had significantly higher baseline corticosterone and glucose compared to controls, suggesting that the previously observed parental buffering may not have been sufficient to mitigate the deleterious effects of food restriction. Furthermore, food-restricted birds had lower body mass compared to controls in adulthood, suggesting that there was a latent effect that manifested in adulthood, potentially due to the physiological costs observed during treatment and the later release of treatment. Furculum fat, the glucose response, and the adrenocortical response did not differ between experimental groups. There was also no difference in brood body size variance between treatment groups, and previously observed parental compensation in food-restricted nests did not correlate with offspring body mass in adulthood. Lastly, there was a significant negative relationship between body mass and baseline corticosterone in adulthood, suggesting that although growth and body mass were maintained during treatment, energy may have been redirected from growth and body mass maintenance to different processes in adulthood. This study further supports the need for measuring traits after treatment ends to determine persistent effects of stressors and highlights that parents cannot fully buffer their offspring from adverse environmental conditions.",

We compare the efficacy of T-DXd, trastuzumab-emtansine (ADC comprising an anti-HER2 antibody and microtubule inhibitor, T-DM1; Kadcyla) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy in HNSCC with low and absent HER2 expression in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment of a low HER2-expressing human HNSCC cell line (FaDu) with T-DXd resulted in dose-dependent cell death (IC50 values of 9856 ng·mL<sup>-1</sup>). T-DXd treatment of FaDu and UMSCC-47 (low HER2-expressing cell line) mouse xenografts displayed antitumor activity (P = 0.0001 and 0.015 respectively). When comparing T-DXd to other approved anti-HER2 therapies, only FaDu mice treated with T-DXd showed a reduction in tumor growth (P = 0.0012). In UMSCC-1 cells (absent HER2 expression), the drug failed to accumulate in tumors and showed no measurable antitumor effect, in contrast to FaDu xenografts, where drug accumulation in the tumor correlated with a therapeutic response. T-DXd treatment yielded antitumor activity in FaDu and UMSCC-47 tumors, highlighting the potential for T-DXd efficacy in low HER2-expressing tumors.",

We report our challenges in establishing the first such service. Patients referred for CRS-HIPeC between February 2018 and November 2023 were discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Prospectively collected data, including patient demographics, extent of disease (radiological stage, peritoneal carcinomatosis index - PCI), pre-operative workup, completeness of cytoreduction (CCR) score and surgical outcomes, were analysed. Of 162 patients referred, 47 (30.0%) underwent CRS-HIPeC. The median age was 59 years (range 20-76 years). Median PCI was 11 (range 1-39). CCR distribution was as follows: CCR 0 - 40 (85.1%), CCR 1 - 2 (4.3%), CCR 2 - 2 (4.3%) and CCR 3 - 3 (6.3%). Median operative time was 645 minutes (range 360 -1575 minutes) with a median length of in-hospital stay of 11 days (range 6-146 days). All patients were initially managed in the intensive care unit. Sixteen (34.0%) patients developed complications of Clavien-Dindo Class 3 and above, with three operative mortalities (6.3%). CRS-HIPeC requires adequate clinical expertise, facilities and volume. Its labour and resourceintensive nature mean that centralization of services is necessary for sustainability. Further evaluation of its costbenefit in our setting will be required.",

MethodsThis study utilized prospectively collected data from the Danish Ventral Hernia Database, maintained from its inception in 2007 to 2023. The data were cleaned and organized by mesh material. All ventral hernia repairs with mesh were included. ResultsA total of 47,716 operations were included, utilizing many different mesh materials. Polypropylene meshes were used in 62% of the repairs, polyester in 26%, and fully absorbable meshes in 0.7%. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-based meshes were most commonly used from 2007 to 2011 but then experienced a marked decline, followed by a slight increase in 2023. While the use of other absorbable components in semi-absorbable meshes followed a rise-and-fall pattern during the study period, only polylactic acid (PLA) showed a steady increase from 2013 onward. ConclusionA wide range of mesh materials and composites have been utilized for ventral hernia repair from 2007 to 2023. Polypropylene-based meshes were most commonly used, followed by polyester. The use of various absorbable composite materials varied considerably over time. The diversity of mesh materials and substantial temporal variations highlight gaps in evidence-based clinical practice and the need for improved regulations. These findings emphasize the importance of developing standardized guidelines for mesh selection in ventral hernia repair.",

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to April 2023. Studies involving at least one child < 18 years who was administered plant-derived or pharmaceutical cannabinoids as an intervention or treatment for medical conditions were included. Of 37 189 identified citations, 276 studies were included: 84 interventional, 131 observational, 54 surveys, and 7 qualitative studies. Among interventional and observational studies, common indications for cannabinoids in children were refractory epilepsy (n = 146 studies, 188 726 participants), cancer and cancer symptoms (n = 30 studies, 208 753 participants), and autism spectrum disorder (n = 18 studies, 1285 participants). Common cannabinoids identified in interventional studies were purified cannabidiol (CBD) (78.6%, n = 66 studies, 5235 participants) with dose range of 2-50 mg/kg/day, tetrahydrocannabinol (6%, n = 5 studies, 148 participants) with dose range of 2.5-10 mg/day (max dose of tetrahydrocannabinol in nabiximols 32.4 mg) and nabilone (6%, n = 5 studies, 267 participants) with dose range of 0.5-2 mg/day. In randomised controlled trials, purified cannabidiol was reported to reduce seizure frequency ranging between 30% and 50%. Common adverse events (> 20% studies) in studies enrolling children were somnolence, diarrhoea, vomiting, and decreased appetite.",

It included three groups: those without CUF (<i>n</i> = 106), low CUF (volume <20 mL/kg; <i>n</i> = 33), and high CUF (volume ≥20 mL/kg); <i>n</i> = 18). HGB levels were assessed at the following points: Pre-operative, end-bypass, first hour in the ICU, discharge, and 30 days post-procedure. Total intravenous fluid administration at 72 hours postoperatively was also evaluated. ResultsThere was no significant difference between the three groups in HGB pre-operatively, end-bypass, or during the first hour in the ICU. At discharge, the non-CUF group had significantly higher HGB levels than the high CUF group (<i>p</i> = 0.028), and HGB in the low CUF group was not significantly different from the high CUF (<i>p</i> = 0.102) group. At 30 days, HGB in the low CUF group was significantly higher than those with high CUF (<i>p</i> = 0.022). Additionally, HGB levels in the non-CUF group were not significantly different than those with high CUF (0.078). Surprisingly, there was no difference in total IV fluid volume administered at 72 hours post-op (<i>p</i> = 0.181) between any of the groups. ConclusionsLow CUF is superior to no CUF, and high CUF in the preservation of hemoglobin levels - even at 30 days. Additionally, CUF of any volume was not associated with increased IV fluid resuscitation postoperatively.",

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 11 providers (27% non-Hispanic Black, 27% Hispanic, 73% cis women) and 16 PWH (31% non-Hispanic Black, 19% Hispanic, 50% cis men, 69% aged 50+) from five sites in Florida. Participants were asked about the groups of PWH who they thought could benefit the most from long-acting ART. Responses were analyzed using a reflexive thematic approach. Seven populations of PWH who could benefit from long-acting ART were identified: 1) younger PWH, 2) PWH with co-occurring conditions, 3) PWH who use substances, 4) PWH experiencing housing instability, 5) PWH with frequent travel, 6) PWH experiencing stigma, and 7) PWH who reliably take medication and engage in care. Many groups who may be excluded from injectable CAB/RPV based on the current guidelines were seen as potentially benefiting from such an option.",

In Catostomus fishes, contemporary hybridization is extensive but variable, and factors influ- encing hybridization dynamics are not fully understood. We used genotyping-by-sequencing data from three Catostomus species (bluehead, white, and flannelmouth suckers) to identify regions of the genome associated with sex using a genome-wide association study. We identi- fied a genomic region in bluehead suckers from Colorado on chromosome 4 that significantly associates with sex and is suggestive of a sex-determining region. This region is not signifi- cant in the other species studied here, or in a divergent lineage of bluehead suckers, implying that either the sex-determining region of the genome differs in these species and populations, or that technical limitations precluded identification of sex determination. These results pro- vide the first description of sex-determination systems in Catostomus species, and suggest that further investigation of sex determination in the Catostomidae are needed to better characterize evolutionary turnover of sex determination in this species-rich group.",

In Experiment 2, immediately after receiving correct answer feedback, individuals chose whether to receive more information (i.e. the explanation of the correct answer; SRL). Individuals were retested after 1 week. In both experiments, young and older adults held similar numbers of misconceptions when initially tested and after feedback. Though young and older adults chose to receive more information about similar numbers of statements, older adults were less likely to choose detailed information about their correct answers compared to younger adults. On the final test, older adults benefitted more than younger adults from only brief feedback, but were less likely to correct their high confidence misconceptions. These findings suggest that older adults' regulation of knowledge learning is preserved, but how older adults' update knowledge may depend on a host of factors.",

Knowing the learning curve after CI could also aid in setting expectations about SI immediately after implantation, and the duration of rehabilitation. The current objectives were to construct learning curves to estimate baseline SI at 1 week (B), maximal SI after rehabilitation (M), and rehabilitation time (time to reach 80% of the learning effect; t[M - B]80%), and to subsequently deploy these outcomes for multiple-regression modeling to predict CI outcomes.

      "content": "SI was assessed with consonant-vowel-consonant words (CVC) in quiet, with phoneme score as the outcome measure. Participants were followed for up to 4 years, with SI measurements collected at fixed intervals. SI was commonly assessed 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after device activation. B, M, and t(M - B)80% were determined from the fitted learning curves. Predictive multiple-regression analyses were performed on these three outcome measures based on eight previously identified preoperative demographic and audiometric predictor variables: age at implantation, duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, best-aided CVC phoneme score (in the free field), unaided ipsilateral and contralateral residual hearing and CVC phoneme scores (measured with headphones), and education type (regular or special education). At 1 week after CI activation, raw phoneme scores had increased from 40% preoperatively (best-aided condition) to 51%, with further improvement to approximately 78% at 4 years. SI increased significantly until 1 year after activation and then plateaued. Fitted learning curves supported better estimates of these parameters, showing that average baseline SI at 1 week after CI activation was 51%, increasing to 85% after rehabilitation. The asymptotic score exceeded the raw average after 4 years because many cases had not yet plateaued. The median t(M - B)80% was 1.5 months. Predictive modeling identified duration of hearing loss, age at implantation, best-aided CVC phoneme score, and education type as the most robust predictors for postoperative SI. Despite the statistically significant correlations, however, the combined predictive value was ~19% for B, 10% for M, and 2% for t(M - B)80%. This study is among the few to generate detailed learning curves after cochlear implantation. By including clinical SI measures in the earliest rehabilitation period, we report a median rehabilitation time with CI of 1.5 months. This implied rapid learning effect emphasizes the value of monitoring SI in the first few weeks after rehabilitation. According to multiple-regression analyses, the most commonly used preoperative variables correlated significantly with postoperative outcomes, but with limited predictive value for the clinic. By fitting learning curves through data reported in the literature, we show that the increase in SI during rehabilitation is an important predictor for t(M - B)80%.",

The primary endpoint was safety based on adverse events (AEs). The secondary endpoints were hemoglobin changes from baseline and the proportion of patients who achieved mean hemoglobin ≥100 g/L. Effectiveness evaluable populations 1 (EE1) and EE2 included roxadustat-naïve and previously roxadustat-treated patients, respectively. The safety analysis set (SAF) included all patients who received ≥1 dose. The EE1, EE2, and SAF populations included 1804, 193, and 2021 patients, respectively. In the SAF, the mean age was 50 ± 14 years, and 1087 patients (53.8%) were male. Mean baseline hemoglobin was 96.9 ± 14.0 g/L in EE1 and 100.3 ± 12.9 g/L in EE2. In EE1, the mean (95% confidence interval) hemoglobin changes from baseline over weeks 24-36 and 36-52 were 14.2 (13.5-14.9) g/L and 14.3 (13.5-15.0) g/L, respectively. Over weeks 24-36 and 36-52, 83.3% and 86.1% of patients in EE1 and 82.7% and 84.7% in EE2 achieved mean hemoglobin ≥100 g/L, respectively. In the SAF, 1643 patients (81.3%) experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). Overall, 219 patients (10.8%) experienced drug-related TEAEs. Thirty-eight patients (1.9%) died of TEAEs (unrelated to the study drug). Vascular access thrombosis was uncommon.

The CAD patients (mean age: 73.4 years) were enrolled. The IL-33, fetuin A, and CK-18 protein levels in pericardial fluid (PF) and plasma of patients with CAD were measured by ELISA, while IL-33 and Fetuin A gene expressions were analysed via quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The IL-33 protein level in PF was significantly higher than plasma (PF: 57.09 ng/L; Plasma: 50.15 ng/L; p < 0.05). Similarly, the fetuin A protein levels were significantly elevated in PF compared to plasma (PF: 1060.53 mg/L; Plasma: 725.85 mg/L; p < 0.05). However, gene expression levels (ΔCt values) for IL-33 and fetuin A were significantly higher in plasma than in PF (p < 0.05). The CK-18 protein levels were comparable between plasma and PF (p > 0.05). Strong positive correlations were observed between CK-18 and IL-33 (r = 0.127, p < 0.001) and between CK-18 and fetuin A (r = 0.096, p < 0.001) in PF. The IL-33, fetuin A, and CK-18 levels in PF are predicted to have the potential to be used as a source of biomarkers for CAD. Although the collection of PF samples requires an invasive procedure, the proximity of PF to the heart tissue makes it a valuable source for understanding cardiac pathophysiology.",

Despite this, the underlying mechanisms by which aberrant cholesterol metabolism influences the development and progression of NSCLC remain unclear. In our study, we observed that OVOL1 is significantly upregulated in NSCLC and is correlated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, our functional assays revealed that OVOL1 enhances the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, OVOL1 was found to modulate cholesterol reprogramming and increase the expression of APOE, thereby intensifying cholesterol metabolism and facilitating cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OVOL1 acts as an oncogene in NSCLC, promoting tumour growth and metastasis through the enhancement of cholesterol metabolism.",

However, the G protein Gα<sub>s</sub> does not interact with known RGS proteins. To understand the molecular basis for this divergent phenomenon, we combined a comparative structural analysis of experimental and modeled structures with functional biochemical assays. This analysis showed that Gα<sub>s</sub> contains unique structural elements in both the helical and the GTPase domains. Modeling suggested that helical domain insertions, which were missing in experimental structures, might project toward the interface with RGS proteins. Alternatively, residues in the Gα<sub>s</sub> GTPase domain might lead to direct interference with RGS binding. Mutagenesis of Gα<sub>s</sub> and measurements of RGS GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity showed that three residues in the Gα<sub>s</sub> GTPase domain are both necessary and sufficient to prevent Gα<sub>s</sub> inactivation by RGSs. Indeed, substitution of all three Gα<sub>s</sub> residues with the corresponding residues from Gα<sub>i1</sub> enabled efficient inactivation by RGS proteins. These results shed new light on the mechanistic bases for G protein specificity toward RGS proteins.",

This study explores the lived experiences of physicians and nurses in keeping hope for dying children and their families within pediatric oncology settings. A qualitative research design was employed, with semi-structured interviews. Participants were selected through purposive sampling. The study was conducted with 23 healthcare professionals (12 physicians and 11 nurses) working in pediatric hematology-oncology units, ensuring at least 2 years of professional experience in Turkey. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Three main themes were identified: (i) The Importance of Hope-coping mechanism and continuing treatment; (ii) Challenges in Keeping Hope-balancing hope and realism, emotional responses and exhaustion, impact of relapse, and professional responsibility; (iii) Strategies for Keeping Hope-individualized communication, providing positive examples, hiding real feelings and thoughts. The findings highlight healthcare professionals' cultural and emotional complexities and underscore the delicate balance between fostering hope and addressing clinical realities. Keeping hope is a pivotal aspect of pediatric oncology care, enhancing emotional resilience and treatment adherence. Healthcare professionals must navigate significant challenges while employing culturally sensitive strategies to keep hope for patients and families.",

Patients initiated their consideration of HSCT within a Vietnamese cultural framework while integrating external influences. Social networks profoundly affect patient autonomy, as patients continuously reflected on their views and engaged with others to maintain their final say in decisions. Participants' interpretation of their significant other's experiences supported and maintained their autonomy. The HSCT decision-making process is shaped by the interplay of patients' personal experiences, trust, socio-cultural relationships, and surrounding support systems. Relational autonomy offers key insights into how patients use social networks and cultural backgrounds to navigate their treatment choices, emphasizing the importance of supportive environments that empower patients to make informed and autonomous decisions.",

We sought to identify correlates of LARC initiation post-MAB in a community-based setting. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to a Planned Parenthood Health Center in Minnesota in 2016 for MAB, chose LARC as their intended post-abortion contraceptive method in counseling, and returned to the clinic for their routine follow-up visit (n = 335). We abstracted sociodemographic and reproductive health history variables and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for LARC initiation post-abortion (≤ 30 days of mifepristone administration). Study participants predominantly self-identified as non-Hispanic and White and had a mean age of 26 years. Overall, 72.8% (n = 244) initiated their desired LARC method by 30 days post-abortion. There was no significant (p < 0.05) association between LARC initiation and most variables: race, ethnicity, age, distance from clinic, body mass index, gestational age, gravidity, prior abortions, and number of children. However, odds of LARC initiation were significantly lower among participants who did not use any health insurance (vs. private insurance) for contraceptive coverage at their MAB follow-up visit (age-adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.69). Findings were similar for initiation of the IUD, specifically (age-adjusted OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.97), but not statistically significant for the implant. Lack of health insurance may be a barrier to LARC initiation for MAB patients. Facilitators of LARC initiation in the context of MAB remain unclear and warrant further research to optimize patient-centered care.",

Time and survival probability were extracted for each Group (HFpEF patients with and without RVD) in each of the Kaplan-Meier curves. Individual patient data were reconstructed by processing the extracted time points, survival probabilities, and the number of patients at risk in a two-stage approach. The restricted mean survival time (RMST) was also calculated as the area under the survival curve for each group. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1936 individuals, of which 555 patients had RVD. The pooled prevalence of RVD among HFpEF was 41.2% (95% CI: 36.5; 45.9). Patients with RVD had a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes compared to those without RVD, with an HR of 2.28 (95% CI, 1.95; 2.68, p-value < 0.001) in the eight-year follow-up after the RVD diagnosis. The one-year landmark analysis revealed that the majority of the event-free survival disparity between patients with RVD and those without arises from the first year after an RVD diagnosis. Patients with RVD also had shorter event-free survival. (ΔRMST = -2.127 years, 95% CI, -2.383; -1.872, p-value < 0.001). The development of RVD in HFpEF is linked to significantly increased composite outcomes of all-cause death and HF hospitalization and shorter event-free survival.",

      "content": "While many common variants are successfully utilized in clinical settings to predict individual drug responses, a significant portion of the genetic basis underlying this variability remains unidentified. This includes rare variants, which are estimated to account for 4-6% of drug response variability. To comprehensively elucidate the functional consequences and molecular mechanisms of rare variants, we conducted in vitro enzyme expression studies combined with in silico structure-function analyses. We selected 11 rare variants in the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genes identified among participants within the Estonian Biobank. Variant cDNAs were heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells, and detailed enzyme activity analyses were performed. The experimental results were further validated against average scores from five optimized in silico prediction models: LRT, Mutation Assessor, PROVEAN, VEST3, and CADD. To explore structure-activity relationships, we performed in silico docking of substrates into available 3D enzyme structures. Our findings reveal that most of the rare genetic variants caused significant functional alterations, including: (i) Likely impairments in substrate transport to the active site due to narrowing of access channels; (ii) Changes in catalytic rates; and (iii) Potential effects on substrate extrusion rates from the active site. The in silico prediction tools accurately anticipated the functional impact of 6 out of the 11 variants (54%). Evaluating the functionality of rare variants will become increasingly essential as rapid and cost-effective whole-genome sequencing technologies continue to advance. Our results highlight the need for further refinement of in silico prediction models, particularly those leveraging 3D crystal enzyme structures, to enhance the accuracy of functional predictions for rare genetic variants.",

      "content": "Quercetin has been found to counteract this process by scavenging free radicals, but its therapeutic effect is limited due to poor water-solubility. Thus, the question of how to deliver quercetin to a target organ effectively with minimal side effects has remained a clinical challenge. Our previous research findings indicate that when quercetin is delivered in the form of liposomal nanoparticles, its targeting efficiency to the liver is significantly enhanced. Although quercetin liposomal nanoparticles have been shown to improve the therapeutic effect on liver damage compared to traditional quercetin treatment, the optimal dosage of liposomal quercetin still warrants further exploration. The aim of this study was therefore to ascertain whether there are differences in the therapeutic effects on liver damage at different dosages of quercetin liposomes and to determine the optimal dosage. 62 rats modeled with liver injury were enrolled and distributed into 4 groups, where they were treated with quercetin liposome nanoparticles, blank liposome nanoparticles, simple quercetin, and normal saline accordingly. Serum samples were measured for liver function indicators, and tissue samples were analyzed by pathohistological examination. Statistical analysis was performed to quantify the difference between the experimental and control groups. Both liver function and histopathological examinations demonstrated enhanced therapeutic effects as the concentration of quercetin liposome drugs increased. Moreover, compared to traditional quercetin treatments, liposomal quercetin nanoparticles of varying concentrations uniformly provide better liver protection, with the highest dose group showing the best therapeutic effect. In addition, low concentration carrier liposome nanoparticles also showed a certain protective effect on the liver damage in rats. Liposomal quercetin nanoparticles exhibit superior efficacy in liver protection and repair compared to pure quercetin, with the highest dose group showing the best therapeutic effect.",

The study aimed to determine whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) alleviate pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy in a rat model of PVOD. Allogeneic ASCs were intravenously administered to a rat model of PVOD induced by mitomycin C. Then, muscularization in pulmonary microvessels, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed using immunohistochemistry, right heart catheterization, heart weight, and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Body weight over time and survival rates were assessed. ASC transplantation substantially contributed to the reduction of pulmonary microvascular muscularization in the PVOD rat model but not to the decrease in RVSP. Furthermore, it led to the attenuation of right ventricular hypertrophy and a considerable decrease in wall thickness. However, repeated ASC administration increased the mortality rate in the PVOD rat models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects of ASC transplantation in a rat model of PVOD. While intravenous ASC transplantation exerts beneficial effects on the lungs and right ventricle, adverse events may occur depending on the administration method. Therefore, intravenous ASC transplantation should be performed with caution.",

      "content": "Chemotherapy is typically the recommended treatment for transformed SCLC (T-SCLC), similar to primary SCLC. However, the benefits of chemotherapy alone are minimal. Prior research highlights differences between the biological traits of T-SCLC and primary SCLC or EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This study aims to elucidate the molecular characteristics of T-SCLC and identify potential treatment modalities. We retrospectively collected tissue samples from LUAD, T-SCLC post-EGFR-TKI resistance, and primary SCLC. Genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics were performed to clarify the differences between T-SCLC, LUAD, and primary SCLC. Hierarchical clustering analysis was then used to categorize the molecular subtype of T-SCLC, followed by a survival analysis based on these subtypes. A study involving 61 patients investigated differences between LUAD, SCLC, and primary SCLC. RNA sequencing revealed distinct gene expression variations, particularly up-regulation in PPM1E, INSM1, and KCNC1 genes in T-SCLC. Pathway analysis linked T-SCLC to the cell cycle and neural differentiation. By conducting Hierarchical clustering analysis on RNA-seq data, the entire population can be categorized into two distinct groups. While certain T-SCLC showed similarities and differences compared to SCLC, with subtypes: LUAD-like and Non-LUAD-like. Notably, the LUAD-like subtype had significantly higher NKX2-1 expression (mean 371.8 vs. 41.8, P < 0.0001). T-SCLC treatment approaches were categorized into matched and unmatched groups, delineated by the alignment of specific therapies with corresponding pathologies. The matched group (13 cases) exhibited a significantly prolonged median progression-free survival compared to the unmatched group (10 cases) (5.4 months vs. 3.6 months, P = 0.02). T-SCLC exhibits marked molecular distinctiveness, setting it apart not only from LUAD but also from classical SCLC. This distinction extends to its classification into two discernible molecular subtypes: LUAD-like and Non-LUAD-like. Customizing therapeutic protocols to align with these specific subtypes have the potential to identify the most appropriate treatment for T-SCLC.",

Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that FH overexpression enhances breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through metabolic reprogramming and by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, we identify matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) as a downstream effector of FH, linked to p21 downregulation, elucidating a novel regulatory pathway influencing tumor behavior. Interestingly, unlike its tumor-suppressing role in other cancer types, this study highlights FH's oncogenic potential in breast cancer. Our results suggest that FH enhances cancer cell viability and aggressiveness via both catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms. This work not only underscores the metabolic adaptations of breast cancer cells but also proposes FH as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer management.",

It expands the scope to include a broader range of control measures, such as monoclonal antibodies, and examines the impact of secondary infections. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Gaps in model focus areas, dynamics, and reporting were identified and described. The TRACE paradigm was applied to selected models to discuss model development and documentation to guide future modelling efforts. We identified 170 transmission studies from 2010 to May 2022; Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 39) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 27) resistance transmission were most commonly modelled, focusing on multi-drug and methicillin resistance, respectively. Forty-one studies examined multiple interventions, predominantly drug therapy and vaccination, showing an increasing trend. Most studies were population-based compartmental models (n = 112). The TRACE framework was applied to 39 studies, showing a general lack of description of test and verification of modelling software and comparison of model outputs with external data. Despite efforts to model antimicrobial resistance and prevention strategies, significant gaps in scope, geographical coverage, drug-pathogen combinations, and viral-bacterial dynamics persist, along with inadequate documentation, hindering model updates and consistent outcomes for policymakers. This review highlights the need for robust modelling practices to enable model refinement as new data becomes available. Particularly, new data for validating modelling outcomes should be a focal point in future modelling research.",

      "content": "Currently, the recombination patterns of NADC30-like PRRSV in China exhibit a high degree of complexity, characterized by low whole-genome sequence homology. The genomic features and epidemiological trends of these strains remain to be elucidated. To evaluate the prevalence of NADC30-like PRRSV in China, this study acquired 30 whole-genome sequences of NADC30-like strains via Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). These sequences were subsequently integrated with 224 whole-genome sequences from China available in the GenBank database. A comprehensive analysis of the genomic characteristics of contemporary NADC30-like PRRSV strains in China was conducted. Recombinant analysis indicated a yearly increase in the number of NADC30-like strains exhibiting recombination signals, whereas nonrecombinant NADC30-like strains have become nearly extinct. Among the recombination events, those involving L1C and L8E as parental strains are most prevalent. Based on the results of recombination and phylogenetic analyses, this study classified 120 Chinese NADC30-like strains with similar recombination characteristics into groups NADC30-R1 to R12. The intra-group genetic distances of the NADC30-R1 to R12 groups approximately 5.73% (SD ± 1.68), while the inter-group genetic distances between different groups are usually stably greater than 10%. The amino acid alignment of Nsp2 demonstrated that all NADC30-R1 to R12 strains exhibit a discontinuous deletion of 131 amino acids. These classifications do not exhibit consistent pathogenic characteristics within groups, with most NADC30-like PRRSVs showing moderate virulence. Geographical distribution analysis indicated that NADC30 whole-genome sequences in China originated from 19 provinces. Notably, the NADC30-R1 and NADC30-R2 strains are the most widely distributed and abundant, suggesting that these variants have established localized epidemics in specific regions. In summary, the vast majority of NADC30-like strains in our country have undergone recombination, L1C + L8E is the most common recombination mode. The NADC30-like strains in China can be classified into 12 different recombination patterns, NADC30-R1 and NADC30-R2 strains are already showing pandemic trends. These findings provide a critical foundation for future NADC30-like PRRSV prevention and control strategies.",

Serum-free medium (SFM) has emerged as a safer and more controllable alternative, but further validation is required to determine its effectiveness and superiority in generating high-quality cell sheets. This study systematically compared cell sheets generated under SFM and 10% FBS culture conditions in terms of structure, cellular phenotype, and functional properties. The expression levels of α-SMA and SM22, markers of vascular smooth muscle cells(VSMCs), were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis to assess cellular phenotype. Histological staining and mechanical testing were employed to compare the morphology and mechanical properties of the cell sheets, while extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and biochemical characteristics were also analyzed. Under SFM conditions, cells exhibited significantly higher α-SMA and SM22 expression levels (qRT-PCR showed a 1.8-fold and 2-fold increase, respectively; ****p < 0.0001) with clearer cytoskeletal arrangement. Cell sheets formed in SFM displayed comparable area(ns, p > 0.05), thickness(**p < 0.01), and mechanical properties to those cultured in 10% FBS, while ECM deposition was significantly enhanced (collagen content increased by approximately 40%, **p < 0.01). Furthermore, histological analysis revealed that cell sheets generated under SFM conditions were more compact and uniform, exhibiting superior structural organization. SFM facilitates the generation of cell sheets that exhibit structural and functional properties analogous to those cultured in FBS. Additionally, SFM promotes cellular phenotype transition and ECM deposition. Consequently, SFM provides a safer, more controllable, and clinically translatable solution for cell sheet construction.",

Four cases of clinical and pathological data were collected from 2018 to 2024. Next generation sequencing with a 654 cancer-associated gene panel was utilized to detect gene mutations. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to evaluate protein expression levels. Firstly, we combined clinical imaging examinations and IHC to exclude the possibility of metastasis from ovarian or pancreatic origins. BMCA was composed of cystically dilated ducts lined by tall columnar mucin-containing epithelium. The morphological spectrum of MCA varied from MCA alone to MCA combined with carcinoma in situ (CIS) to MCA associated with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). ER/PR/HER2 and CK20 were all negative, while CK7 and GATA3 were positive by IHC in four cases. Although the prognosis of the other three patients was favorable during the follow-up periods of 13, 10, and 3 months, respectively, case 2# experienced a recurrence of the primary focus after 42 months. No lymphatic metastasis was identified in cases 1-4#. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified 17 mutated genes and 25 mutation sites in four cases. TP53, PIK3CA, AKT, PTEN, and RB1 were the highest frequency mutated genes. Given that AKT mutations typically refer to AKT1(E17K) rather than AKT2 or AKT3, AKT protein expression was detected only in Case 2# (AKT1, E17K). PTEN protein was expressed in case 4# (corresponded to missense mutation), loss of PTEN expression were corresponding with splicing mutation in case1#. In brief, AKT and PTEN protein expression could be corresponded to gene mutation in a certain extent. However, PIK3CA protein expression was positive in Case 2# but negative in Case 1#, which did not fully accordance with the NGS-detected missense mutations. No associated germline variations were detected. Additionally, neither PDL-1 expression nor microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status was identified. The tumorigenesis and development of BMCA may be regulated to the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consequently, a comprehensive genetic analysis of more cases could elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this rare tumor.",

The fusion models were constructed from the feature level and the decision level respectively. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the prediction ability and prognostic value of radiomics, deep learning, and fusion models. The diagnostic performance of radiologists of varying seniority with and without the assistance of the optimal model was compared. The late fusion model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.812) compared to clinical (AUC = 0.650), radiomics (AUC = 0.710), deep learning (AUC = 0.770), and the early fusion models (AUC = 0.586) in the external test cohort. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the VPI status predicted by the late fusion model were independently associated with patient disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.044). Furthermore, model assistance significantly improved radiologist performance, particularly for junior radiologists; the AUC increased by 0.133 (p < 0.001) reaching levels comparable to the senior radiologist without model assistance (AUC: 0.745 vs. 0.730, p = 0.790).

A pilot study showed the potential and feasibility of Stopcoach but as yet no research exists that assesses the effectiveness of Stopcoach. This study aims to evaluate whether using Stopcoach in combination with group-based smoking cessation counselling (SCC; intervention group) increases short- and long-term abstinence compared to SCC alone (control groups). Secondarily, this study aims to assess acceptability of Stopcoach as perceived by people who smoke and SCC group coaches. This multi-methods study was originally designed comparing an intervention group (n = 242; 2020-2022) to a historical control group (n = 3362; 2018-2020) that did not use Stopcoach. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hampered realistic comparison due to declining abstinence rates. Therefore, a COVID-era control group was added (n = 312; 2020-2021). All participants enrolled in professionally led SCC groups. The primary outcome was abstinence at four weeks and one year after quit date. In the intervention group, usability, acceptability and usefulness were also measured. In a qualitative assessment, eight SCC trainers were interviewed to explore acceptance by trainers and integration of Stopcoach into SCC. Due to the COVID-19 related overall decline in abstinence rates, the intervention group had lower abstinence rates compared to the pre-COVID control group (73.6% vs. 78.2% p < 0.001). However, the COVID-era control group revealed that Stopcoach, as addition to accredited SCC, was associated with higher abstinence rates after four weeks than SCC alone (73.6% vs.",

With the global prominent rise in aging populations, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the aging process and developing strategies to combat age-related diseases have become a pressing priority. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained significant attention due to their role in intercellular communication. EVs are known for their ability to deliver biocargoes, such as miRNA, proteins, and lipids, implicating their involvement in disease pathogenesis and intervention. In this review article, we explore the dual role of EVs in age-related diseases: contributing to the pathogenesis of diseases by transferring deleterious molecules, while also offering therapeutic ability by transferring beneficial molecules. We also highlight the application of EVs as biomarkers for early diagnosis of age-related diseases, paving the way for early intervention and precision medicine.",

Most triads conserved a similar homoeolog expression bias pattern as one or both parents. Inherited patterns were largely driven by changes in the expression of one homoeolog, allowing homoeolog expression bias in subsequent generations to match parental expression. Novel patterns of homoeolog expression bias occurred more frequently in the biparental population from a landrace × elite cross, than in the population with two elite parents. These results demonstrate that there is significant reprogramming and stabilization of homoeolog expression bias within a small number of generations that differs significantly based on the parental lines used in the crossing.",

      "content": "The paper used recent Demographic and Health Surveys of four countries in Central Africa (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, and Chad). Multilevel binary logistic regression analyses (additive and multiplicative models) were carried out. Findings were reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Findings indicated an inverse-relationship between the percentage of women living in polygamous marriages and IPV. Indeed, the percentage of polygamous marriages was higher in Chad (34.3%) compared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (18.6%), Cameroon (14.6%), and Gabon (13.9%). However, the percentage of women who experienced intimate partner violence in the last 12 months was lower in Chad (18.9%) compared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (43.5%), Gabon (40.3%), and Cameroon (30.8%). In multivariate results, findings showed that a sizeable percentage of intraclass correlation (ICC) of IPV in the selected countries was explained at cluster level: ICC = 18.2% [95%CI: 15.0%-21.9%]; ICC = 14.3% [95%CI: ICC = 10.9%-18.5%]; ICC = 7.8% [95%CI: 5.3%-11.3%]; and ICC = 29.5% [95%CI: 23.7%-35.9%] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Gabon and Chad, respectively. Community polygyny (from Model 2) showed different patterns. In the DRC, it was positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of IPV (aOR = 2.890; 95%CI: 1.461-5.719). In contrast, it showed a negative association with IPV in Cameroon (aOR = 0.278; 95%CI = 0.143-0.539); in Gabon (aOR = 0.504; 95%CI = 0.237-1.074); and Chad (aOR = 0.749; 95%CI = 0.319-1.763). Findings from this study substantiates the importance of moving beyond individuals' characteristics and incorporating the collective mindset of polygyny to fully capture the effects of polygyny on intimate partner violence in Central Africa. Previous research pointed out the negative effects of polygyny at individual level. This study showed that community polygyny, since communities might differ on the acceptance levels towards polygyny, is equally important to understand how polygyny could affect the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Central Africa. Therefore, interventions aimed at eliminating intimate partner violence should integrate communities' influences on intimate partner violence in Central Africa and worldwide.",

      "content": "Ribotype (RT) 027 poses a particular risk due to its proposed \"hypervirulence\". Traditionally, C. difficile isolates are characterized using PCR-ribotyping. More recently, whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis is increasingly used, which may provide a higher discriminatory power. This study aimed to assess the distribution of different C. difficile RTs in hospitals in the Berlin-Brandenburg area, and to analyse the heterogeneity within isolates of different ribotypes using WGS. Between February 2020 and November 2021, stool samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed CDI were collected from 22 hospitals (approximately 13,900 beds) in Berlin and Brandenburg. Toxigenic isolates (n = 476) were further characterized by ribotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing, toxinotyping, and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Sixty-five different RTs were detected, with RT014 (16.1%), RT027 (12.8%), and RT001 (7.6%) being the most prevalent. RT027 isolates exhibited resistance to several antibiotics. Further, cgMLST analysis revealed very close genetic relatedness between RT027 isolates despite being epidemiologically unrelated. Similar findings of a monomorphic population were observed for RT078 isolates. In contrast, other RTs showed a heterogenic population structure. This study provides first insights into the distribution of C. difficile genotypes, corresponding antimicrobial resistance, and clonal relatedness using cgMLST, highlighting RT027 as the second most common genotype for the studied area. For the monomorphic RT027 and RT078 populations, new definitions of clonal relatedness might be necessary.",

Data between 2017 and 2019 were categorised as the pre-COVID-19 time, while data between 2020 and 2022 were the per-COVID-19 time. Denmark had a remarkably greater AMU in animals (about 10 times greater) than Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Iceland had the highest human AMU, while Sweden had the lowest. Drug categories, countries, and sectors were significant predictors in the model used to fit human AMU. Bacterial species and drug categories were significant predictors in the models used to fit human resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The COVID-19 time was not a significant predictor in these models. Among the Nordics, Iceland had the lowest number of resistant isolates; however, high human AMU remains a great concern for Iceland. The study provided insight into current existing AMR surveillance systems in the Nordics. It also showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had very little impact on AMU and AMR in theses countries. This implied that strict regulations on AMU as well as well-coordinated national AMR surveillance systems in the Nordics mitigated the development of AMR crisis also during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Nordics would still benefit further from a standardized AMR surveillance at regional level, which ultimately facilitate timely information sharing and improve our preparedness for and response to future pandemics and/or large-scale outbreaks.",

Slightly lower cumulative pregnancy (33% vs 39%) and live-birth (25% vs 30%) rates and higher miscarriage rate (53% and 29%) were observed in HPV + with respect to HPV - cycles. Fifty-five neonatal outcomes from HPV - (n = 45) and HPV + (n = 10) cycles were available. No stillbirths as well as no malformations were recorded.

However, the cost-effectiveness of this model has yet to be determined. The cost-effectiveness analysis simulates a Chinese birth cohort using a calibrated Markov model based on individual data from a prospective cohort of the Guangzhou Lung Cancer Screening Program. Health utility was extracted from the literature. Cost parameters were obtained from the price of basic medical services in public medical institutions. Our analysis evaluated 236 distinct screening strategies, varying by screening initiation age, risk thresholds, and smoking status. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). For smokers, four strategies on the efficiency frontier yielded incremental QALYs ranging from 0.011 to 0.039 compared to no screening, with ICERs ranging from $21,874 to $55,038 when compared to the previous efficient strategies. The optimal strategy was annual screening of smokers aged 45 years and older with a 3-year risk of lung cancer incidence of 0.55%, offering the largest gain in QALYs at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $38,224 (three times GDP per capita). This optimal strategy dominated the 2023 Chinese guideline-recommended strategy. For nonsmokers, the strategies on the efficiency frontier yielded incremental QALYs ranging from 0.006 to 0.041 compared to no screening, with ICERs ranging from $26,517 to $37,994 when compared to the previous efficient strategies. Correspondingly, the optimal strategy is annual screening of nonsmokers aged 45 years and older with a 3-year risk of lung cancer incidence of 0.20%. This economic evaluation found that lung cancer screening strategies based on the Chinese NCC-LC<sub>m2021</sub> model were cost-effective for both smokers and non-smokers in China. Furthermore, tailoring risk thresholds to smokers and nonsmokers can enhance the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening.",

Transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically using a constant comparative approach. SSI in digestive surgery was perceived as an inevitable consequence and ranked down in the priorities of surgeons. A paradox existed between the low consideration of superficial infections that are easily manageable through antibiotics and the strong awareness of the antibiotic resistance threat. Global trust appeared regarding the guidelines, but a knowledge gap of the guidelines was observed among surgeons in comparison with anesthetists. SSI ownership was perceived as collective, but the responsibility belonged to the surgeon alone. Surgeons focused on actions and short-term tasks within a culture of individualism, whereas anesthetists worked collectively with systemic approaches. Overall, the cooperation between both specialties was positive, but tightly reliant on teamwork, workload, and organization in the operating theatre. The cultural differences between surgeons and anesthetists should be recognized as a key overarching factor in defining their respective roles in the prevention of SSI and in establishing accountability in digestive surgery - including aspects such as adherence to guidelines, and the implementation of preventive measures.",

      "content": "Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). However, in the context of improved medical and device therapy for HF, it is unknown whether the influence of socioeconomic deprivation on HF outcomes is changing over time, especially in relation to evolving life expectancy patterns in the general population. Therefore, we aimed to describe temporal trends in the association of socioeconomic deprivation with loss of actuarially predicted life expectancy amongst ambulatory patients with HF. Between 2006 and 2014, 1802 patients (73.2% male, mean age 69.6 years) with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% were consecutively recruited across four hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK). Patients were stratified into socioeconomic deprivation tertiles defined by the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score with IMD tertile 1 denoting the least deprived and IMD tertile 3 the most deprived. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and relative survival predictions-in relation to age- and sex-matched background mortality rates-were calculated using UK National Life Tables. Relative survival was illustrated in terms of excess mortality risk and years of life expectancy lost. Recruitment period was split into 3-year intervals (2006-2008, 2009-2011 and 2012-2014). During a median follow-up of 5.0 years, 1302 participants (72.3%) died. Unadjusted mortality rate was highest in tertile 2. However, adjusted to the age-sex matched UK population, a stepwise increase in excess mortality risk was observed across tertiles, with tertile 1 experiencing an excess mortality risk of 11.1% (95% CI: 6.1-16.1%) and tertile 3 24.2% (95% CI: 19.4-28.0%). This corresponded to a loss of life expectancy of 1.76 years (95% CI: 1.50-2.03) for tertile 1 and 2.30 years (95% CI: 2.03-2.57) for tertile 3 over a 10-year period. We observed disparity in actuarial survival between tertiles over time, with participants in tertile 1 losing less life expectancy at 10 years compared to those in tertiles 2 and 3. However this was only statistically significant for those recruited between 2012 and 2014 (p < 0.05).",

A cross-sectional survey study included 150 participants. All participants' average knowledge score of CT head artifact was good (77.81%). The most correctly identified CT head artifacts were the metal artifact (86%), ring artifact (84.7%), and motion artifact (81.3%). The beam hardening artifact was correctly identified less frequently (62%). There is significant difference in the recognition of motion artifacts among the participants (P = 0.001) knowledge of CT head image artifacts improved significantly with more experienced participants (P = 0.001), where participants with less than 10 months of experience had a higher rate of incorrect responses (85 incorrect vs. 31 correct). The recognition of these artifacts improves with experience and advanced age. Understanding these artifacts is essential to avoid misdiagnosis of various diseases.",

      "content": "Clinical manifestations vary and SCD patients experience increased morbidity and mortality. In Italy, SCD patients cluster into two distinct subpopulations: those of sub-Saharan African descent and those of Caucasian descent. Most sub-Saharan African SCD patients are children or young adults and carry the homozygous genotype hemoglobin (Hb) S, or SC, whereas Caucasian SCD patients tend to be older and have predominantly HbS/β-thalassemia. Patients of African descent typically present with acute SCD-related events, including vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, anemia, fever, and pneumonia. Caucasian patients, according to the different distribution of SCD genotypes, may exhibit either acute episodes or chronic long-term complications. Regardless of age, genotype, or ethnic background, most SCD patients in Italy are undiagnosed, and pain, fatigue and anemia should be regarded as presenting signs and symptoms of this disease. The tests needed to diagnose SCD are simple, and a complete blood count together with erythrocyte morphology, wherever available, hemolysis markers, should be performed whenever SCD is suspected. If a patient presents with two risk factors -family history, ethnicity, or a significant clinical feature - a first-level screening test (e.g. assessment of Hb fractions with HPLC), where available, should be performed immediately, or a referral should be provided. Here, we present an overview of the clinical features of SCD that may be encountered in real-world clinical practice in Italy from a practical perspective. This narrative review may aid non-specialist physicians in identifying disparate clinical conditions that may be symptoms or signs of SCD.",

      "content": "Since rehabilitation programs often do not enhance long-term physical activity in persons with a health condition, there is a great need to arrange rehabilitation concepts towards a stronger emphasis on sustainable physical activity promotion. In this regard, the model of physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) offers the potential for optimizing physical activity promotion. In the context of medical rehabilitation, the STABEKO study uses a co-creation approach to modify existing exercise and physical therapy according to PAHCO and long-term physical activity promotion in three rehabilitation centers in Bavaria, Germany. The objectives of the STABEKO study are A) to evaluate the implementation of modified exercise and physical therapy and to identify influencing factors for development and implementation, and B) to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of the modified therapy on PAHCO and physical activity of the persons undergoing rehabilitation. As part of the STABEKO study, we will use cooperative planning as a co-creation approach for planning, developing, and implementing actions to modify exercise and physical therapy by engaging relevant actors from practice, policy, and research in an equal decision-making process. Within a multicenter controlled hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study, we will simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of modified exercise and physical therapy by collecting, analyzing, and triangulating qualitative and quantitative data at several measurement time points. The STABEKO study will provide comprehensive insights into the implementation and effectiveness of exercise and physical therapy in medical rehabilitation, modified using a co-creation approach to promote long-term physical activity of persons undergoing rehabilitation. While the implementation study will indicate which modifications could be achieved and which factors have influenced their development and implementation, the effectiveness study will investigate whether modified exercise and physical therapy lead to changes in PAHCO and physical activity in persons undergoing rehabilitation. The results of this study will determine the dissemination of long-term physical activity promotion in the German rehabilitation sector and will provide important information for modifying existing therapeutic concepts to improve their effectiveness and implementation at an international level.",

      "content": "Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign, locally aggressive bone lesions that commonly affect young adults and adolescents. These cysts, which may cause pain, fractures, or deformities, are often associated with vascular or abnormal bone resorption processes. Though their etiology is not fully understood, an intriguing and rarely discussed correlation between aneurysmal bone cysts and endocrine disorders, particularly primary hyperparathyroidism, has been reported. Hyperparathyroidism, usually resulting from a parathyroid adenoma, promotes osteoclastic activity, which can lead to bone resorption and potentially the formation of aneurysmal cysts. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism can be challenging, especially in the absence of characteristic clinical signs. A 47-year-old Albanian Caucasian female individual, with a body mass index of 40, presented with coxalgia and an incidental finding of an osteolytic lesion in the right sacral wing on pelvic X-ray. Subsequent imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, confirmed the presence of a large aneurysmal bone cyst. Despite its size, traditional surgical interventions were not pursued owing to the discovery of primary hyperparathyroidism, as indicated by elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. A parathyroid ultrasound revealed an atypical adenoma in the left lower parathyroid, confirming the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. The patient underwent successful parathyroidectomy and left thyroid loboistectomy with a favorable outcome. Postsurgical follow-up revealed normalization of metabolic parameters and clinical resolution of symptoms, with stable dimensions of the sacral cyst. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in patients with bone lesions, particularly in those with risk factors for metabolic bone disorders. Primary hyperparathyroidism, although rare, can manifest with bone abnormalities such as aneurysmal cysts. A multidisciplinary approach, including timely diagnosis and surgical intervention, is crucial for optimal management and preventing long-term complications.",

A total of 139 patients (58.40%) had no ACB score, 64 (26.89%) had an ACB score of 1, and 35 (14.71%) had an ACB score of 2 or higher. ACB scores were significantly higher among patients with heart disease, and ACB tended to increase with age. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between ACB and mean blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure dips, or any parameters of short-term BPV including Sd, SD-CoV and wSD. No significant association was found between ACB and short-term BPV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this relationship, which may inspire further research.",

      "content": "The relationship between MP DNA positivity and age in children is not well understood. We aimed to explore trends in MP DNA and antibody detection rates with age in a pediatric population. This retrospective study analyzed data from 1,161 children under 14 years old hospitalized with suspected MP infection. The study included clinical presentations and laboratory tests, and all participants underwent chemiluminescence and nucleic acid detection for MP antibodies and DNA, respectively. We analyzed the relationship between age and MP DNA and antibodies in our study. The mean age of the children was 49.7 ± 32.6 months. Laboratory data showed mild elevations in inflammatory markers and normal liver function tests, reflecting the generally moderate severity of MP infections. The study revealed that the positive rate of MP DNA was 9.0%, and it was negatively correlated with children's age (r = -0.21, P < 0.001). The positive rate of MP IgM antibody was 7.1%, and it was positively correlated with children's age (r = 0.18, P < 0.001). The positive rate of MP IgG antibody was 6.3%, and it was not correlated with children's age (r = 0.03, P = 0.36). These results suggest that MP DNA detection identifies the MP infection earlier and more accurately than antibody detection and that younger children are more susceptible to MP infection than older children. Given the sensitivity and specificity of MP DNA found in young children in this study, it is recommended that it should be considered in routine clinical practice for early diagnosis and intervention.",

Forty-eight healthy controls (HCs) and 69 CM patients (36 with MOH; 33 without MOH) were recruited. QSM data were acquired using a 3.0 T Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regions of interest (ROI) in the DGM, including the bilateral caudate, putamen, globus pallidus (GP), hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, were segmented from the T1-weighted images (T1WI) of the whole brain of each individual patient using FreeSurfer. QSM images were registered to T1WI. QSM values within each ROI were extracted and compared between CM and HCs, as well as between CM with MOH and CM without MOH. Correlations between QSM values and clinical assessment scale scores were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of QSM values in these DGM for detecting CM and CM with MOH. Compared to HCs, CM patients exhibited increased iron deposition in the caudate (p = 0.013) and putamen (p < 0.001). In the CM without MOH group, headache duration correlated positively with iron deposition in the caudate (r = 0.502, p = 0.010) and putamen (r = 0.514, p = 0.009). CM with MOH patients showed greater iron deposition in the caudate (p < 0.001), putamen (p < 0.001), and GP (p = 0.049) than those without MOH, with medication use frequency correlating positively with iron deposition in the caudate (r = 0.427, p = 0.023) and putamen (r = 0.445, p = 0.018). ROC curve analysis indicated that the caudate (AUC = 0.736) and putamen (AUC = 0.729) exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing CM with MOH. CM patients with MOH had excessive iron deposition in basal ganglia regions, including the caudate, putamen, and GP, which may be related to the medication overuse behavior. Iron deposition in the caudate and putamen may be a potential biomarker for CM with MOH. These findings provide insight into the common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MOH and potential addiction.",

Recent advancements have shed light on the molecular underpinnings of immune aging and pioneered novel therapeutic interventions to counteract its effects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-a type of multipotent stromal cells with regenerative potential, low immunogenicity, and strong immunomodulatory properties-are increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic option to reverse or alleviate immunosenescence-related dysfunction. This review systematically summarizes recent discoveries on how MSCs counteract immune aging, particularly their ability to rejuvenate aged immune cells and restore immune homeostasis.",

This study describes how PHVMs were implemented on the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa Reservation lands in Minnesota (United States) and associated costs during the first 24 weeks of operations. We summarize the steps undertaken to implement PHVMs on reservation lands. We describe formative research in which we assessed willingness to use a PHVM among a sample of people who use drugs. Then, we describe how we worked with community members to ensure the appropriateness of a PHVM initiative. Finally, we present utilization data from the first 24 weeks of PHVM operations and describe associated implementation costs. In May 2022, the academic research team presented to the Bois Forte Reservation Tribal Council about PHVMs and requested a Resolution that authorized their implementation on Reservation lands. The Resolution was unanimously approved, and the team began working with a local Community Research Council to determine the most appropriate way to implement the PHVMs. Prior to implementation, we conducted a survey among people who used drugs (N = 227) on Reservation lands and found that most (56%) reported willingness to use PHVMs if they were available. In October 2023, two PHVMs were installed. During the first 24 weeks of operations, there were 2,534 successful dispensations at the PHVMs. Items dispensed through the PHVMs included COVID-19 test kits, naloxone, drug test strip kits, menstrual supply kits, wound care kits, sterile injection equipment kits, pregnancy tests, safer sex kits, and HIV self-test kits. In total, the PHVM initiative cost approximately $30,406.75 (USD) during its initial 24-week implementation period. The Bois Forte Band of Chippewa took swift action upon learning about the potential public health benefits of PHVMs and immediately authorized their implementation, catalyzing a collaborative effort between local community members and academic partners. Thousands of life-sustaining supplies were dispensed at the PHVMs, supporting the prevention and treatment needs of the community.",

Then, MR-Clust was applied to examine the potential presence of distinct causal pathways underlying the BMI-eBMD link. Utilizing tissue-partitioned MR, we estimated the distinct effects of separated tissue-specific subcomponents of BMI on eBMD, further supplemented by multivariable MR of body composition phenotypes on eBMD. We reconfirmed the significant positive association between genetically predicted BMI and eBMD (β<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.13, P value = 1.28 × 10<sup>-34</sup>). Potential distinct causal pathways contributing to the observed total effect were identified by MR-Clust, with some exerting a protective effect while others leading to its deterioration. Tissue-partitioned MR suggested a marginally independent protective association between skeletal muscle-tissue instrumented BMI and eBMD (β<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.14, P value = 4.98 × 10<sup>-2</sup>) after accounting for adipose-tissue instrumented BMI, which was supported by the independent association between genetically predicted lean mass and eBMD after accounting for other body composition phenotypes. Our results shed preliminary insights into the intricate relationship between obesity and bone mass, highlighting divergent causal pathways underlying the association between BMI and eBMD. Our findings emphasize the potential importance of precision obesity management over merely a general indicator as BMI in future public health strategies for osteoporosis prevention.",

      "content": "Various intraoral donor sites for autogenous block graft are presented in the literature. However, vital anatomic structures can limit intraoral bone block graft surgeries, and they must be evaluated in detail. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dimensions and volume of the maximum potential symphysis block graft donor site and their relations to the anterior loop of mental foramen. According to inclusion criteria, 408 cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were evaluated. Mental foramen diameter, anterior loop length, the maximum potential symphysis graft dimensions (height, width, and length) and volume were measured. Prevalence of anterior loop of mental foramen was calculated 30.15% (123 patients) for right and 29.66% (121 patients) for left sides. The length of anterior loop of mental foramen was measured for right and left side 4.470 ± 1.355 and 5.223 ± 1.599, respectively. The maximum potential symphysis graft height, width, length, and volume were 13.253 ± 3.261 mm, 12.694 ± 1.711 mm, 34.353 ± 2.944 mm, and 3.102 ± 1.013 cm 3, respectively. Presenting anterior loop has no significant effect on the maximum potential symphysis graft height (P = 0.560) and width (P = 0.242). However, the maximum potential symphysis block graft length (P = 0.017) and volume (P = 0.026) were decreased by increasing number of anterior loops of mental foramen. The mandibular symphysis bone block graft can be reliably selected as the donor site for a number of different augmentation procedures. However, there are restrictions owing to surrounding anatomical structures such as mental foramen and anterior loop. These vital structures should be considered using accurate CBCT evaluation. Presenting anterior loop of mental foramen is limiting symphysis bone block graft length and volume.",

      "content": "A prospective, hospital-based study was conducted in Singapore. Two thousand seven hundred fifteen women were recruited from 2014 to 2016 (45-69 years old) and 1201 women were followed up from 2021 to 2023. At baseline, age at menarche (AAM) was divided into sub-categories: < 12 (early AAM), 12-13, 14-15 (reference), > 15 years. Major adiposity indices and glycemic profiles were assessed, including fat mass index (FMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance). At the 6.6-year follow-up, T2D was assessed. One-way ANOVA and chi-square were performed for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine the association between AAM and primary outcomes, including adiposity measurements (FMI, VAT) and metabolic assessments (HOMA-IR) at baseline. Modified Poisson regression was performed to assess relative risk (RR) between AAM and T2D at follow-up. Serial mediation analysis was performed to determine potential mediators underlying the link between AAM and T2D. All analyses accounted for major confounders including age, ethnicity, and education. Women with early AAM had significantly greater values in adiposity assessments, including increments in FMI (10.9 vs 10.3, p < 0.001), VAT (134 vs 113 cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.05) and HOMA-IR (1.20 vs 1.03, p = 0.08) at baseline. Early AAM (< 12 vs. 14-15 years) was associated with a 60% increased risk of developing T2D (RR 1.60 (95%CI: 1.04, 2.45)). Serial mediation analysis suggested a significant pathway underlying early AAM and T2D, which was firstly mediated by FMI, followed by VAT and lastly by HOMA-IR (p < 0.05). Our study provided valuable insight into the pathophysiology of T2D development amongst mid-life women with early AAM. The findings could potentially indicate strategies to target FMI and VAT among Asian women in the menopausal phase with early AAM, to prevent the development of T2D.",

This study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, prospective, phase III trial. Patients with unresectable HCC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TACE-apatinib or TACE-alone treatment. Patients in the TACE-apatinib group began with a dosage of 500 mg/day of oral apatinib administered 4 days after the first TACE. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to untreatable (unTACEable) progression (TTUP), and safety assessment. From November 1, 2018 to November 18, 2021, a total of 196 patients were randomly assigned to either the TACE-apatinib (n = 86) or TACE-alone (n = 92) group. The median PFS in the TACE-apatinib group was significantly longer than that of in the TACE-alone group (6.1 months vs. 3.4 months, p < 0.0001). The median OS was significantly prolonged in the TACE-apatinib group compared to the TACE-alone group (28.9 months vs. 24.0 months, p = 0.0005). The median TTUP in the TACE-apatinib group was 26.8 months, which was significantly longer than that of 20.1 months in the TACE-alone group (p = 0.0003). A significantly higher ORR and DCR were observed in the TACE-apatinib group compared to the TACE-alone group (ORR: 58.1% vs. 31.5%, p < 0.001; DCR: 87.2% vs. 69.6%, p = 0.004). Most of the treatment-related adverse events were grades 1-2, and no treatment-related deaths were observed. Apatinib significantly improved the treatment effects of TACE for patients with unresectable HCC. TACE-apatinib could serve as a promising treatment option for this patient population, offering notable survival benefits while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.

      "content": "We retrospectively reviewed 13 patients with comminuted transolecranon fracture-dislocations of the elbow. Our study included 6 males and 7 females with a mean of age 54.3 years. All the patients had comminuted fracture of proximal ulna and coronoid fracture of Regan-Morrey type II/III. Among them, 4 cases were combined with radial head fractures. The patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with suture lasso combined with lateral plate based on the traditional mode. The mean follow-up was 15.7 ± 5.8 months (range 12-33 months). During the follow-up period, the fracture and joint alignment were good, and there was no loosening of internal fixation. X-ray films showed that the fracture healing time was 3-6 months, with an average of 3.8 ± 0.9 months. Mild postoperative heterotopic ossification was observed in 2 cases. There was 1 case of poor wound healing and 1 case of ulnar nerve stimulation. At the last follow-up, the average Mayo elbow function score and Broberg-Morrey score were 91.5 ± 9.2 and 94.7 ± 6.5 points respectively. The result was classified as excellent in 9, good in 3, and fair in 1 patient. The excellent and good rate was 92.3%. Our study suggested that suture lasso combined with lateral plate based on the traditional internal fixation mode was highly effective for the treatment of transolecranon fracture-dislocations of the elbow. Especially for the patient with comminuted proximal ulna, the restoration and fixation of coronoid process were quite important to increase the stability of the elbow joint and lead to good clinical efficacy.",

In women, higher FMR was associated with a higher incidence of gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, thyroid, breast, and uterus cancers (FDR < 0.05). Non-linear associations were observed for several cancer types, with specific FMR cut-off points presented using RCS curves. The analysis by combining BMI and FMR suggested potential interaction patterns, revealing some masked risks; for example, a significant increase in cancer incidence was also observed in individuals exhibiting high FMRs despite having low BMI.

Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines, and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate associations. A significant association was found between oral microbial diversity and diabetes. According to the completely adjusted model, a one-unit increment in the Shannon-Wiener Index was associated with a 12.1% increase in the likelihood of developing diabetes (OR = 1.121, 95%CI: 1.120 ~ 1.122). Subgroup analyses showed divergent findings. In subgroups with lower body weight and BMI, increased microbial diversity correlated with a decreased likelihood of developing diabetes (OR = 0.68 (0.68-0.68)); Conclusions: Oral microbial diversity exhibits a complex relationship with diabetes risk. The increase and subsequent decrease of oral microbiota diversity in relation to diabetes risk. This suggests that certain specific microbes or interactions between microbes may influence the development of diabetes. However, due to the many limitations of this study, it cannot prove the causal relationship between oral microbial richness and diabetes. Further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are essential to elucidate the causal links and dynamic alterations between the oral microbiome and the progression of diabetes.",

      "content": "Post-therapeutic surgical and/or dental interventions on the jawbone carry a risk of developing osteoradionecrosis (ORN). To mitigate this risk, dental examinations and, if necessary, treatment should be conducted prior to RT. However, the consistent implementation of these recommendations in routine dental practice remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate whether insured persons of AOK Saxony-Anhalt (AOK ST) utilise dental services in accordance with current treatment recommendations and whether this behaviour influences the need for post-therapeutic tooth removal and the occurrence of ORN. Anonymised health claims data were analysed from individuals newly diagnosed with HNC between 2017 and 2021, who received RT and were continuously insured by AOK ST from 1 year before the start of RT to 2022. Three dependent variables were evaluated: dental treatment prior to RT, tooth extraction after RT, and ORN occurrence. Independent variables included sex, age, tooth extraction before RT, need for care, exemption from copayment, bisphosphonate prescription, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol abuse, chemotherapy, and guideline adherence. Data from 1,086 patients with HNC diagnoses (75.9% male) were analysed. The median follow-up time from the first RT was 796 days (first quartile: 316 days; third quartile: 1,210 days). Twenty-one patients (1.9%) developed ORN after RT. More than 50% of the study population received dental care in accordance with guideline recommendations prior to RT. Need for care had the most significant negative effect on the utilisation of dental treatment prior to RT. This study did not find evidence of consistent implementation of the recommended guidelines for dental assessment/therapy prior to RT. Patients in need for care and those with chronic comorbidities were less likely to receive and/or require dental care. Although no significant influence on ORN development was observed, the reliability of this finding is limited by the small cohort size and low ORN incidence. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings.",

Using these compounds, we prepared metal-porphyrin nanoparticles and evaluated their properties. Results from multiple assays demonstrated that both PTA and PTBA exhibited significantly enhanced photodynamic therapeutic activation under laser irradiation compared to TCPP. This included improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) and singlet oxygen release, as well as superior antitumor activity. When prepared as metal-porphyrin nanoparticles, all three compounds-PCN224 (TCPP with Zr⁴⁺), PMOF01 (PTA with Zr⁴⁺), and PMOF02 (PTBA with Zr⁴⁺)-showed significantly upregulated photodynamic therapeutic effects. These nanoparticles induced the accumulation of ROS and singlet oxygen in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells and demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity under laser irradiation. Notably, PMOF01 and PMOF02 exhibited much stronger antitumor effects compared to PCN224 in LSCC cells. Our findings highlight the photodynamic therapeutic potential of these novel porphyrin compounds and their nanoparticles. These results not only expand our understanding of porphyrins' antitumor capabilities but also provide new options for PDT applications.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted from April 2024 to October 2024, involving 350 elderly MHD patients from three tertiary hospitals in China. Participants were stratified into two groups based on VAS scores: the VA dissatisfaction group (n = 220) and the VA satisfaction group (n = 130). Data collection utilized the Short Form Vascular Access Questionnaire (VAQ) and the Chinese Version of the Demoralization Syndrome Scale. Binary logistic regression and independent t-tests were employed to analyze predictors of VAS and DS scores. Significant differences in VAS scores were observed between the dissatisfaction and satisfaction groups (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified living alone (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2), prolonged dialysis duration (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0) as independent risk factors for VAS, while higher hemoglobin levels (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) served as a protective factor. Notably, the dissatisfaction group exhibited markedly higher DS scores (73.6 ± 8.7 vs. 51.2 ± 6.9, p < 0.01), indicating a strong association between VAS and psychological distress. This study underscores a robust correlation between VAS and DS in elderly MHD patients. Interventions targeting social support optimization, anemia management, and mineral metabolism regulation may improve vascular access outcomes and mitigate demoralization, thereby enhancing quality of life.

A guided prompt-flow approach is employed to generate query expansions, retrieve relevant excerpts, and synthesize coherent, evidence-based reports. Preliminary evaluations across claims from the SciFact benchmark dataset reveal that Valsci significantly outperforms base GPT-4o outputs in citation hallucination rate while maintaining a low misclassification rate. The system is highly scalable, processing hundreds of claims per hour through asynchronous parallelization.

Crucially, PRE's efficacy despite low systemic bioavailability implicated microbiome-mediated \"luminal priming\" as its primary mechanism. This study redefines preventive RSV as a microbial ecosystem engineer that preemptively fortifies the gut against inflammation via microbiome-immune-metabolic crosstalk. By prioritizing ecological prevention over symptom suppression, our findings offer a transformative \"food as medicine\" strategy for IBD, highlighting RSV's potential as a chronotherapeutic agent to reshape clinical paradigms.",

We investigated 1,324 patients with MI admitted to our hospital between January 2012 and December 2023 (mean age, 68 ± 14 years; 76% males). Patients with constipation were defined as those using laxatives regularly. During the follow-up period (median, 2.7 years), 115 patients died, and 99 were re-hospitalized due to HF. Landmark Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed incidences of 7.8% and 2.1% hospitalization due to HF from 0 to 0.5 years (log-rank: p < 0.0001) and 4.8% and 3.9% from 0.5 to 3 years (log-rank: p = 0.17) among patients with and without constipation, respectively. The adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of hospitalization due to HF from 0 to 0.5 years in patients with constipation than in those without it (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.19; p = 0.032).

      "content": "All hospitalized patients with chest pain undergoing first-time CAG demonstrated no ST-T changes on initial and pre-CAG electrocardiograms and normal initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels. Plasma microRNA-1 levels were measured via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction within 3 h of chest pain onset. UA patients were followed up for 5 years through phone calls and outpatient visits. The endpoints included second CAG and all-cause mortality. A total of 127 patients were enrolled, with 62 in the UA group and 65 in the non-UA group. MicroRNA-1, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diabetes duration were significantly greater in the UA group than in the non-UA group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for microRNA-1 in diagnosing UA was 0.811. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that microRNA-1 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were predictive factors for UA. No UA patients were lost to follow-up or died during the follow-up period. Patients who underwent a second CAG had significantly higher microRNA-1 levels than those who did not. Binary logistic regression revealed that microRNA-1 and hemoglobin a1c were predictive factors for second CAG in UA patients during follow-up. Cox regression analysis revealed that microRNA-1 was an independent risk factor for a second CAG during follow-up in UA patients. Using the Youden index, the optimal cut-off value of microRNA-1 (2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>) for UA diagnosis was determined to be 1.510, which stratified UA patients into high- and low-expression groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the microRNA-1 high-expression group had a significantly greater proportion of second CAG than did the microRNA-1 low-expression group. For type 2 diabetes patients with acute chest pain, no ST-T changes on electrocardiograms, and negative high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, microRNA-1 may offer early diagnostic value for UA and could serve as an independent risk factor for the need for a second CAG within 5 years.",

After pre-test genetic counseling, all couples underwent carrier screening through ES. We defined high-risk couples as those at an increased risk of inherited genetic disease in their children, and classified them as Category I (couples with a significant obstetric history, such as a previous fetus or child with a suspected genetic disorder), Category II (couples with a family history of a suspected genetic disorder in a parent or close relative) and Category III (couples opting for expanded carrier screening without any significant contributory history). Category I was further subcategorized based on the phenotype of the affected fetus, neonate, or child into: Ia - multiple malformations including non-immune hydrops and skeletal dysplasia; Ib - features suggestive of other system involvement; Ic - neurological phenotype with or without intellectual disability; and Id - unexplained intrauterine/neonatal death or stillbirth. Of the 137 couples evaluated, 130 (95%) belonged to category I, of which 48/130 (37%) were subcategorised as Ia, 61/130 (47%) as Ib, 8/130 (6%) as Ic and 24/130 (18.5%) as Id. Nine couples had more than one subcategory indication for ES. Four couples (3%) belonged to category II, and three (2%) belonged to category III. Consanguinity was noted in 23.4% (32/137). The overall diagnostic yield in the cohort was 38.7% (53/137), mainly contributed by category I (52/130, 40%), with the highest yield in subcategory Ib (39/61, 64%). Carrier screening by ES is useful for identifying couples at high risk of having an offspring with genetic disorders. The yield is higher in couples with an affected previous pregnancy. ES allows comprehensive carrier screening in genetically diverse populations.",

Understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the molecules used in the inhalation treatment is crucial for dose optimization and drug product development. This review examines the clinical PK characteristics of key inhaled PH drugs (approved and investigational agents), including epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil, vardenafil, imatinib, seralutinib, MK-5475, milrinone, and sodium nitrite. We provide detailed analyses of their PK parameters and explore how disease conditions, inter-subject variability, and inhaled formulations and devices impact clinical PK characteristics. Future research would focus on how disease-specific factors affect drug behavior and the prediction of pulmonary drug concentrations. This will support more precise drug delivery and personalized treatment strategies for PH.",

To compare in-hospital mortality rates and length of stay (LOS) among patients with ICH treated at a comprehensive stroke center in Alabama versus large urban hospitals across the US, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 425 ICH patients treated at the academic comprehensive stroke center in Alabama (2016-2019) and 68,525 patients from the NIS (2016-2018).

The modern Luque trolley technique (MLT) was developed to reduce open lengthening and complications. This study aimed to compare the reoperation rates between the MLT and other growth-friendly surgical techniques. Prospective EOS patients were recruited and treated with MLT; matched historical controls were selected from the Pediatric Spine Study Group (PSSG) database. The primary objective was to test if within 3 years of surgery MLT patients would have fewer reoperations. Secondary outcomes were growth, curve correction, and quality of life using the 24-item early-onset scoliosis questionnaire (EOSQ-24). Safety analysis was performed for the MLT patients. MLT (N = 18) and control patients (N = 43) had similar baseline age, body measurements, etiology, Cobb angle, and spinal length. Within 3 years of surgery, 1/18 MLT patients required a reoperation compared with 30/43 controls, conditional Poisson regression rate ratio = 0.02 (95% CI 0; 0.12) (P < 0.001). The median time to first reoperation was MLT, 5.4 years and control, 0.8 years. The MLT achieved the same curve correction as the controls at 3 years. The total spinal growth (T1-S1) was similar between the groups, although the thoracic spinal growth (T1-T12) was less in the MLT group. No difference was observed in standing heights and EOSQ-24 scores. Within 3 years, 2 MLT patients had recurrence of deformity (risk = 11.1%, 95% CI 1.4; 34.7) and 1 had implant loosening (risk = 5.6%, 95% CI 0.1; 27.3).

Stress was induced by asking participants to solve mental arithmetic tasks under time pressure while receiving negative feedback. During the decision-making task, participants chose between a safe and a risky option with monetary incentives. Behavioral and EDA (n = 34; due to technical issues) data confirmed that stress induction was successfully implemented. Participants took less risky decisions post-stress than post-control. An fMRI contrast analysis revealed that the right fronto-opercular and the left anterior part of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) exhibited significantly lower activation during decisions post-stress than decisions post-control. The results indicate that decisions taken immediately after exposure to the acute stressor are less risky. Furthermore, decisions post-stress are associated with reduced activation in the regions of the dlPFC, possibly leading to lower cognitive control and less deliberate decision-making post-stress. Interventions to increase dlPFC activation might be suitable to improve the decision-making post-stress.",

We show here that trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes and that its combination with rapamycin was additive. Combination treatment reduced liver tumors in both sexes and spleen tumors in male mice, blocked the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake and strongly reduced inflammation in brain, kidney, spleen and muscle and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conclude that trametinib is a geroprotector in mice and that its combination with rapamycin is more effective than either drug alone, making the combination a candidate for repurposing as a gerotherapy in humans.",

Strikingly, targeted activation of this pathway mitigated navigational impairments in older mice. In sum, our results revealed an excitatory PV<sup>MVN→DTN</sup> pathway that impacts navigation.

The biosensor utilizes a CuMOF@InMOF architecture, enhanced with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), to improve electron transfer, surface area, and overall stability. Thiolate nucleic acid aptamers, highly specific to dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine, are immobilized on the biosensor surface, enabling precise and simultaneous detection of these key neurotransmitters. The flexible, multi-electrode platform is integrated into a microfluidic patch that adheres to the skin, facilitating seamless sweat collection and continuous neurochemical analysis. Structural validation confirmed the successful synthesis of the CuMOF@InMOF architecture with enhanced surface area, stability, and electron transfer properties, contributing to the biosensor's high sensitivity and selectivity. Impressively, the biosensor achieved detection limits of 0.18 nM for dopamine, 0.33 nM for serotonin, and 0.27 nM for epinephrine, with a broad dynamic range from 1 nM to 10 µM. Performance was validated through square wave voltammetry and amperometry, demonstrating exceptional sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.",

Behavioral tasks demonstrate greater sensitivity to state variables which may be a key reason for changes in ranked performance across time. The present study examines a single impulsivity task, the escalating interest task, and considers the design principles that may alter the within-session stability of the assessed behavior. A reanalysis of existing data is contrasted with new behavioral data to reveal that rapid changes in task contingencies produced more stable individual differences than prolonged exposure to each contingency. This outcome may be driven by expanding the number of contingencies experienced at each assessment or by keeping behavior in transition. An attempt to avoid floor or ceiling effects by increasing the ambiguity of the contingency, however, did not produce the desired result. The implications of these results for the escalating interest task as well as other behavioral tasks are considered.",
