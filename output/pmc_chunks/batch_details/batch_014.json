      "content": "This cross-sectional study evaluates the regulatory alignment of 40 clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov, focusing on the methodological challenges. The study highlights methodological inconsistencies, particularly around the challenges of functional unblinding caused by ketamine's dissociative effects, addressing expectancy bias, and the inadequate safety monitoring practices in many trials. A notable concern is the variability in blinding techniques, with many trials failing to adequately mask the perceptual effects of ketamine, potentially compromising outcome assessments. Furthermore, the placebo response, which accounts for a significant portion of treatment effects, was not consistently managed across trials, and safety strategies, particularly for monitoring adverse events such as dissociation and abuse potential, were not uniformly robust. Another critical issue is the lack of long-term follow-up in most trials, limiting the understanding of ketamine's safety profile over extended periods. The findings emphasize the need for harmonized and rigorous methodological frameworks to support the effective use of ketamine and its enantiomers in clinical practice. The potential lessons learned from these trials could be instrumental in guiding future research on other psychedelics currently under investigation for mental health disorders, such as psilocybin and DMT, ensuring both efficacy and safety in future therapeutic approaches. Such harmonization will be crucial to improve regulatory approval and achieve therapeutic success in real-world applications, making these treatments more accessible and reliable for patients with TRD.",

While the relative uncertainty in straw pyrolysis net impact is low, relative digestate pyrolysis net impact uncertainty is substantial. The digestate dewatering process and storage methane emissions are the main sources of uncertainty and are the primary areas with potential for optimization. The results indicate a substantial improvement potential for full system optimization. Efficient harvesting of dry matter and carbon for pyrolysis in dewatering is critical while ensuring that benefits are not offset by increased storage emissions from the resulting liquid fraction.",

However, there are also some drawbacks in this practice, particularly the fact that chlorinated disinfectants can generate disinfection by-products (DBPs) which in turn have been associated with adverse health effects, including birth defects. The extent to which such adverse reproductive effect may occur following chlorinated water consumption, and the possible threshold of exposure involved, are however not entirely clear. This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between DBP exposure and the risk of congenital anomalies, with a focus on exposure thresholds. We conducted systematic search in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science up to March 18, 2025, to retrieve the observational studies assessing DBP exposure and reporting congenital anomalies and birth-related outcomes.",

The meta-analysis comparing the highest versus the lowest exposure levels found a positive association between trihalomethanes (THMs) and prevalence at birth of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neural tube, urinary tract defects, as well as most growth-related birth outcomes. The dose-response analysis revealed a nonlinear association, with increased risks for anencephaly, musculoskeletal, and orofacial defects at THM levels exceeding 60 μg/L, and for term low birth weight at levels above 30 μg/L. A plateau effect was observed for urinary tract defects at 30 μg/L, while low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age infants showed a nearly linear association with DBP exposure. These findings suggest that high THM exposure, particularly above certain thresholds, increase the risk of growth and urinary tract defects, findings that are also supported by biological plausibility. Given existing regulatory limits (80-100 μg/L in US and EU), our results indicate the need for stricter standards to protect vulnerable populations such as pregnant women.",

      "content": "Wastewater-based epidemiology has recently emerged as a promising tool for determining the prevalence of infectious diseases in a community. In the present study, human sapoviruses (HuSaVs) detected in wastewater collected weekly from January 2023 to March 2024 were analyzed using qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the results were compared with those from clinical surveillance samples obtained from patients with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The detection trend of HuSaV in wastewater agreed with the clinical surveillance data in that HuSaV genomes increased in the cold season. In wastewater surveillance, five genotypes were detected, including GI.1, GI.2, GII.3, GII.5, and GV.1. GI.2 was not detected in the clinical surveillance. In the phylogenetic analysis, VP1 gene sequences obtained from wastewater were positioned in close proximity to those obtained from clinical samples. It is suggested that the results of wastewater surveillance reflect the status of ongoing HuSaV infection in a community. Interestingly, GV.1 was detected less frequently than GI.1 in clinical surveillance samples, but was predominantly detected in wastewater at nearly all time points, accounting for up to 94.5 % of all reads in November 2023. In particular, in November 2023, most gastroenteritis outbreaks and pediatric AGE cases were attributable to GI.1, but GV.1 was present at a higher proportion in the wastewater surveillance than GI.1. Wastewater surveillance was shown to complement clinical surveillance in that the former might be able to cover asymptomatic carriers.",

Epifluorescence and confocal laser microscopy revealed synergistic interactions during dual-species biofilm development, further supported by principal component analysis, which highlighted distinct growth patterns between mono- and dual-species biofilms. Specifically, mono-species biofilms of E. coli EMC17 had a biovolume of 56.70 ± 1.36 μm<sup>3</sup>/μm<sup>2</sup> at 96 h, whereas dual-species biofilms reached 62.61 ± 1.38 μm<sup>3</sup>/μm<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, dual-species biofilm-associated cells exhibited significantly enhanced adhesion (16.40 %) and invasion (2.07 %) potential compared to the mono-species biofilms. Furthermore, a combinatorial inhibition strategy using quercetin and citric acid demonstrated synergistic activity against the MDR strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC) of <0.5. These findings offer new insights into the dynamics of dual-species biofilms, emphasizing the potential of phytochemical-citric acid combinations as promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics in biofilm management.",

We examined the temporal stability of IPASE scores, their correlation with APS, and whether they predict changes in APS over time. The baseline sample included 185 participants (healthy controls = 72, UHR = 66, first-episode psychosis = 47), with 29 UHR participants re-assessed at month-12. Correlations between IPASE scores and Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) positive symptom scores were evaluated at baseline and month-12. Stability between baseline and month-12 IPASE scores was examined in the longitudinal subsample. Regression was used to predict remission and change in CAARMS scores. Although mean IPASE scores were significantly higher in the UHR group compared to HCs, total IPASE scores were only weakly correlated with CAARMS total scores (ρ=0.27). IPASE subscales showed weak correlations (0.08<ρ<0.27) with CAARMS positive symptom domains. Changes in IPASE and CAARMS scores were not correlated. Moderate stability was found for IPASE total scores (ICC = 0.59) and four subscales (0.58 < ICC < 0.64), excluding the cognition subscale (ICC = 0.3). Baseline IPASE scores did not predict remission (partial R<sup>2</sup>=0.05) or change in CAARMS scores (partial R<sup>2</sup>=0.02). The IPASE is a moderately stable measure in UHR individuals, correlates with the presence of positive psychotic symptoms but only weakly with severity, and does not strongly predict positive symptom change.",

Of the 104,309 patients that tested HIV negative across all sites, 1851 (1.8 %) were eligible for a HPS referral, of which 1548 (83.6 %) received ED HPS information. After receiving ED HPS information, 988 (63.8 %) were referred to an outpatient HPS appointment. Of those who were referred and linkage data was available (N = 696), 497 (71.4 %) attended their outpatient HPS appointment. Two sites reported that 29 of the 39 patients who attended an appointment (74.4 %) were started on PrEP. We identified three models used to identify HPS eligibility (Behavioral Risk Assessment, STI-based Risk Assessment, and Automated Risk Assessment) and two models for making HPS referrals (Primary and Secondary). ED HIV screening programs can be leveraged to implement HPS. Different models for identifying and referring eligible patients to HPS allow for flexible integration. Each model has strengths and weaknesses for addressing the prevention care cascade and for informing practice.",

      "content": "A total of 28 studies involving 1877 patients were included in the analysis, demonstrating that sclerotherapy significantly preserved ovarian reserve, as evidenced by a smaller change in anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations compared with cystectomy. Additionally, IVF outcomes favoured sclerotherapy, with higher clinical pregnancy rates and an increased number of total oocytes, metaphase II oocytes and embryos. However, the differences in fertilization rates and gonadotrophin dosage were not significant. Based on these findings, sclerotherapy should be considered as a viable treatment option for women with endometrioma, particularly for those with low ovarian reserve who are concerned about their future fertility. This treatment appears to offer the dual benefits of preserving ovarian function and enhancing fertility outcomes after treatment.",

The rats' oestrous cycle was consistently evaluated from the initiation of BPA exposure, and observation was continued for 21 days after the exposure had ended. Serum sex hormone concentrations, blood glucose metabolism, ovarian morphology and fertility were investigated. Adolescent exposure to BPA resulted in irregular oestrous cycles and abnormal ovulation in female rats. Compared with the control group, BPA exposure increased the serum concentrations of testosterone, LH, insulin and glucagon, but reduced the serum concentrations of oestradiol, prolactin, sex hormone-binding globulin and anti-Müllerian hormone. BPA exposure during adolescence caused ovarian atrophy in the rats in adulthood but did not lead to polycystic changes in the ovaries. Moreover, female rats exposed to BPA showed a significant decrease in terms of litter number and weight. Exposure of adolescent female rats to BPA induced a PCOS-like syndrome that was similar to clinical subtype B of PCOS in adulthood and led to a marked decline in fertility. The findings further extend the research on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in reproduction, which would help to shed light on the pathogenesis of PCOS.",

Resistance to P-AscH increased the ability to detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, altered redox metabolism and cell cycle regulation, however mechanisms to P-AscH resistance were different in the cell lines studied. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated a significant enrichment of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal gene expression pattern in the cell lines studied, suggesting that upregulation of metastatic phenotypes occur during acquisition of resistance to P-AscH. Cells resistant to P-AscH demonstrated increased invasive potential, more aggressive tumor colonization, and higher abundance of circulating tumor cells in vivo. Our data support that resistance to oxidative stress enhances metastatic disease and indicates a potential route for PDAC to tolerate high levels of P-AscH and may explain why some patients do not respond to this treatment regimen.",

Transcriptome and NAD<sup>+</sup>-targeted metabolomics analyses were conducted on ischemic hindlimb muscle endothelial cells (ECs). The role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in postischemic neovascularization was studied using global knockout mice. Mechanisms regulating IDO1 expression were investigated through transcriptomics and functional experiments. The effects of IDO1 protein on postischemic neovascularization were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Plasma IDO1 levels were measured in young and elderly PAD patients and correlated with clinical indicators of PAD. In aged mice, ECs exhibited decreased NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo synthesis and IDO1 transcription. IDO1 deficiency induced the decline of ECs NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo synthesis and ECs senescence, impaired neovascularization in young mice. Elevated IL-17A/F inhibited IDO1 transactivation via CREB, impairing neovascularization. IDO1 administration alleviated the decline of ECs NAD<sup>+</sup> de novo synthesis and ECs senescence, and enhanced neovascularization in aged mice. Plasma IDO1 levels were lower in elderly PAD patients, correlating positively with disease severity, onset risk, and cardiovascular outcomes. ECs NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism imbalance is driven by decreased de novo synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup> and targeting IDO1 to elevate NAD<sup>+</sup> levels could be a potential therapeutic direction for elderly PAD patients.",

An online 24-question survey was distributed via the International Neurological Ketogenic Society (INKS) between March and May 2024. Responses from 53 healthcare professionals (HCPs), including dietitians and physicians, from diverse global regions were analyzed. Most HCPs adopt individualized KDT weaning protocols, often after 2 years of effective KDT, with weaning durations typically lasting 2 to 6 months. Factors influencing discontinuation include seizure control, epilepsy syndrome, diet tolerance, and family preferences. EEG monitoring and ketone tracking during weaning are common practices. For effective KDT, a gradual reduction in dietary ratio is preferred, with various strategies used (e.g., stepwise ratio reduction, liberalizing carbohydrates). Adherence issues and concerns about seizure recurrence are frequent challenges. KDT weaning remains a heterogeneous and under-studied aspect of treatment. Despite variations in protocols, common themes include cautious tapering and syndrome-specific considerations. These findings highlight the need for prospective studies to establish evidence-based data for KDT discontinuation.",

The study aimed to investigate the factors associated with disposition of patients from district hospital ED. A retrospective descriptive study using 1,565 triage charts and admitting medical records was conducted for the period June through December 2020. A binomial logistic regression investigated patient and facility factors related to patient disposition. The moderated mediation model evaluated the effect of patients' urgency on the disposition of the patients from the ED. Referring facility, HIV status, patient-level of acuity, length of stay in the ED, and the waiting time for the doctor were predictors of the disposition of the patients from the ED (p = 0000). Waiting time for a doctor's consultation is positively and significantly associated with length of stay in the ED (p < 0.001). The findings highlight the need for an efficient triage system, as delays in care can adversely affect patient outcomes. Addressing challenges related to prolonged length of stay (LOS) and doctors waiting time are also essential for optimizing patient flow. Enhancing triage processes and conducting further research are crucial for improving emergency care efficiency and safety.",

      "content": "This quantitative study employed an online cross-sectional survey. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted using Stata 13. For the students who confirmed their desire to migrate, an additional exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). A total of 614 students drawn from 14 African countries participated in the study, with a significant majority (93 %) expressing a desire to work in another country. The desire to fulfil self-aspirations was the most common push factor identified by students (Agree - 35.2 %, Strongly agree - 43.96 %; Overall - 79.16 %). In the exploratory factor analysis, five factors were identified, explaining 58.84 % of the variation in the data. These factors included social, Health System, economic, Political, and Professional factors. The opportunity to gain better clinical experience was the major pull factor identified, with 56.39 % of students strongly agreeing with this statement. The potential emigration of future skilled healthcare professionals poses major ramifications for Africa's healthcare workforce. Understanding these migration intentions could allow policymakers to develop strategies that improve local opportunities, strengthen healthcare facilities, and foster an environment that retains talent and stimulates career development in the region. Addressing the migration intentions of radiography students in Africa requires a proactive, multifaceted approach. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, African healthcare systems can more effectively retain future radiography professionals and enhance the sustainability of the workforce.",

No significant differences between the pDLD and the low-SES groups were found on lexical and morphological knowledge. However, the low-SES group outperformed the pDLD group in both learning an artificial morphological rule and learning new pseudowords. These findings indicate that children from low SES, as a group, exhibit diminished language performance similar to that of children with pDLD when tested on conventional measures of accumulated linguistic knowledge yet outperform children with (persumed) DLD when assessed on their ability to learn and make use of new linguistic information to extract morphological rules and establish novel lexical representations. The potential of ALL paradigms in this population is discussed.",

This study confirmed the score distribution, internal consistency, and factor structure in a Japanese sample via an online survey. We also compared the MQ-J scores between individuals with misophonia symptoms and control participants. Additionally, we examined the relationships between the MQ-J and sensory processing issues, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and difficulties in daily life. Results demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = .93) for the MQ-J, with significantly higher scores in the misophonia group compared with the control group. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed with sensory processing problems, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and difficulties in daily life. These findings supported the validity and reliability of the MQ-J. Hence, the MQ-J was a valuable tool for assessing misophonia symptoms in Japanese adults.",

The main reported indications for urinary catheterization in hospitalized children include managing acute urinary retention, urine output monitoring, specific surgeries, lumbar epidural analgesia, perineal wounds, and end-of-life care. Ambiguous policies were reported regarding routine catheterization to prevent acute urinary retention. The main factors influencing catheter insertion and removal were the risk of re-catheterization, patient distress, staff capacity and skills, awareness of catheter presence, variation of local practice, usage of protocols, and established criteria for urinary retention. Studies that described a sustained effect on reducing inappropriate urinary catheter use included a daily checklist, with or without a designated expert focusing on reducing catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Indications for urinary catheterization in hospitalized children largely mirror adult practices, with ambiguity concerning routine catheterization for acute urinary retention.

      "content": "Despite the profound advancements that deep learning models have achieved across a multitude of domains, their propensity to learn spurious correlations significantly impedes their applicability to tasks necessitating causal and counterfactual reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Neural Network, which innovatively consolidates forward causal reasoning with inverse counterfactual reasoning into a cohesive framework. This integration is facilitated through the implementation of multi-stacked affine coupling layers, which ensure the network's invertibility, thereby enabling bidirectional reasoning capabilities within a singular architectural construct. To augment the network's trainability and to ensure the bidirectional differentiability of the parameters, we introduce an orthogonal weight normalization technique. Additionally, the counterfactual reasoning capacity of the Bidirectional Neural Network is embedded within the policy function of reinforcement learning, thereby effectively addressing the challenges associated with reward sparsity in the blood glucose control scenario. We evaluate our framework on two pivotal tasks: causal-based blood glucose forecasting and counterfactual-based blood glucose control. The empirical results affirm that our model not only exemplifies enhanced generalization in causal reasoning but also significantly surpasses comparative models in handling out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, in blood glucose control tasks, the integration of counterfactual reasoning markedly improves decision efficacy, sample efficiency, and convergence velocity. It is our expectation that the Bidirectional Neural Network will pave novel pathways in the exploration of causal and counterfactual reasoning, thus providing groundbreaking methods for complex decision-making processes.",

      "content": "Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) has emerged as a captivating photocatalytic material given its cost-effectiveness, ease of fabrication and outstanding stability. However, its practical implementation as a light-responsive nanozyme is fundamentally constrained by suboptimal catalytic activity. Herein, cobalt was incorporated into g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets, giving rise to the formation of cobalt-doped graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (Co/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), which significantly enhanced its light-responsive oxidase-mimicking activity primarily attributed to its notably enhanced visible light absorption capacity and optimized photo-generated charge carrier separation/transfer efficiency. When exposed to visible light illumination, Co/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> triggered the chromogenic reaction by facilitating the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) owing to the generation of hydrogen oxide, singlet oxygen and photogenerated holes. Furthermore, capitalizing on the inhibitory effect of thiocholine on the TMB oxidation, a new colorimetric method was established to determine acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This colorimetric method enabled determination of AChE activity ranging from 0.1-15 mU/mL, achieving a remarkably low detection limit of 0.04 mU/mL. Moreover, it was effectively utilized to ascertain AChE activity in serum samples with desirable results. Additionally, it was successfully applied to detect AChE inhibitor. This work not only advances the modulation of catalytic activities in light-responsive nanozymes, but also presents an innovative perspective for AChE activity determination.",

To collate and synthesize existing evidence on the effects of EHE on pregnant people and fetuses and relevant mitigating factors and interventions to inform healthcare providers and other pregnancy-focused audiences. A peer-reviewed search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CAB Abstracts, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Public Health, for empirical studies and reviews published between 2009 and 2023 in English and French. The search strategy focused on terms related to EHEs, exposure, and pregnancy. Health outcomes, risk factors and interventions relating to EHEs (defined based on high ambient temperature thresholds) were reviewed and narratively reported. Sixty-eight studies were included (n = 16 reviews; n = 52 empirical studies). Associations between both adverse fetal outcomes (e.g., pre-term birth) and maternal outcomes (e.g., severe maternal morbidities) and EHEs were identified. Pregnant people with low socioeconomic status were found to be more likely to have morbidities. Interventions such as improved clinician support have been proposed by researchers to reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. There is an association between EHEs and the development of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality, mediated by environmental, social and intrinsic individual factors. There are remaining knowledge gaps that have been identified that should be addressed, but more importantly, the synthesis of this evidence highlights the urgent need for interventions such as improved healthcare provider education, and policy interventions to mitigate the health riskscaused by exposure to heat in pregnant populations.",

Twenty-three and 17 pwMS were classified as having or not having CPLB, respectively. Participants with CPLB exhibited significantly slower gait speed (cm/s) (p = 0.01, mean difference (MD) 27.64 [95 % CI: 5.8 to 49.4]), fewer number of steps (p = 0.01, MD 14.20 [95 % CI: 2.90 to 25.50]), shorter steps (p = 0.04, MD 7 95 % CI: 14.2 to 25.5), prolonged steps (s) (p = 0.02, MD -0.11 [95 % CI:0.20 to -0.01]), lower percentage (p = 0.01, MD 2.70 [95 % CI: 0.50 to 4.9]) and higher variability (p = 0.01, MD 12.5 [95 % CI: 52.6 to 6.7]) of single-leg support (SLS) time compared to those without CPLB.

It poses a significant risk of comorbidities, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and increased healthcare costs. The challenges in delirium management, follow-up, and rehabilitation, arising from complex chronic conditions and long-term complications after severe burns, highlight the urgent need for more research in this area. Thus, this study aims to investigate the incidence of delirium and the risk factors specific to this population. This analytical observational prospective cohort study was conducted between August 2022 and January 2024. Adults (18 years and older) admitted to a single burn unit with a confirmed burn injury were included, regardless of burn severity. Sociodemographic and clinical variables included age, sex, extent of burn, and prior health status. Delirium assessment was made using the CAM-ICU scale at least twice a day. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium and its risk factors, with secondary outcomes including the onset and duration of delirium episodes. The sample consisted of 50 patients, with a delirium incidence of 52 %. Burn patients admitted to the burn unit developed delirium an average of 11.81 days (95 % CI=7.09-16.52) after hospitalization, with an average duration of 11.5 days (95 % CI = 7.28-15.72).",

In addition to lowering blood glucose levels by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, SGLT2i also affects sodium transport and improves cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. The influence of gliflozins on the metabolism and function of endothelial cells is not well understood. Endothelial dysfunction, which occurs in the single layer of cells lining the blood vessels, often precedes damage to heart muscle cells during HF. This dysfunction can manifest in two ways: 1) obstructive atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries due to subendothelial inflammation and lipid plaque deposition and 2) microvascular dysfunction stemming from structural and functional changes in smaller blood vessels. Both factors contribute to the progression of HF and reduce the amount of oxygen supplied to the myocardium. This review aimed to explore the latest findings from preclinical and clinical studies regarding the effects of gliflozins on endothelial cell function, mitochondrial activity and energy metabolism. Targeting endothelial injury may prove beneficial in preventing and treating both macro- and microcirculatory dysfunction, delaying heart failure progression and supporting cardiac regeneration.",

Accumulated evidence suggests that the inflammatory response of endothelial cells (ECs) plays an important role in the occurrence and progression of various types of PH. The inflammatory response of ECs leads to ECs hyper-proliferation, anti-apoptosis, endothelial barrier function damage and vasoconstriction through activating multiple pathways and secreting the mediators, and finally accelerating pulmonary vascular remodeling and the progression of PH. The inflammatory response mediated by ECs plays a significant role in the development of PH. A better exploration of the role of endothelial inflammatory response in PH will be conducive to effectively prevent and treat PH.",

Combinatorial screening of the arising 256-member library yielded a selection of possible hits, of which four were further characterized. Variant P6H7 contained 7 of the 8 mutations (excluding V276Y) and showed the highest significant kcat, 17 % higher than FLT and 30 % higher than LpTan, and a 4.5 °C increase in Tm. Variant P8E5 with 6 of 8 mutations (excluding A257D and G439D), yielded a 6.5 °C increase in Tm compared to FLT. The two other variants showed more moderate increases, albeit still greater than FLT or LpTan. Overall, the ability to design thermal stabilized versions of a tannase is emphasized.

PVDF membranes were prepared through either simple blending modification or blending combined with <i>in situ</i> cross-linking by cationic photopolymerization, respectively. The hydrophilicity of the modified membranes was enhanced, and the adsorption capacities of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA) were significantly reduced. The water contact angle of M0 was 86.1°. At the same time, M5 had the lowest contact angle of 63.3°. M5 also exhibited the lowest adsorption (16.2 and 5.4 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> for BSA and HA, respectively), which were significantly lower than those of M0 (45.1 and 22.0 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). The optimum membrane M5 with superior hydrophilic and antifouling properties had the highest retention for BSA and HA, as well as flux recovery rates (FRR). During the first water-BSA-water cycle test, M5 exhibited the highest FRR (80.6%), while M0 had a much lower FRR of only 46.5%. A similar trend was observed in the water-HA-water cycle test, where M5 achieved the highest FRR (91.0%) in the first cycle. In addition, M5 also showed excellent stability and still maintained excellent hydrophilicity and permeability after 48 h of ethanol immersion.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSGT in patients with severe DED. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. Outcomes, including symptomatic improvement, changes in Schirmer test (ST) value, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal staining (CS) value, and adverse events (AEs), were extracted for further analysis. Proportional analysis was used for binary data, and mean difference was used for continuous data. All meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effect model, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were included. Eight studies involving 150 patients (158 eyes) were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The symptoms of DED improved in 73.6% of patients. Regarding signs, the pooled ST values improved by an average of 3.684 mm, TBUT increased by 1.823 seconds, and CS decreased by 1.966. The most common treatment-related AEs to MSGT were hypaesthesia of lip (10%), cosmetic problems (3%), and epiphora (2%). In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrated that MSGT can potentially treat severe DED without severe AEs.",

      "content": "The telemonitoring group received mHealth support in addition to standard care. Over 12 months, participants measured blood pressure (BP) twice weekly with 2 consecutive readings each morning and evening, using the second reading as valid. Blood glucose (BG) was measured monthly, both fasting and 90 minutes after meals. Abnormal results triggered a 7-day BP or 1-day BG profile or a teleconsultation with a general practitioner. Meanwhile, the control group received routine care based on integrated care protocols at community health centers. Primary outcomes were the differences between groups in the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HbA1c levels at 12 months after inclusion from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in diastolic blood pressure, fasting BG, lipid profile, body mass index, appraisal of diabetes, and behavioral risk factors. Initially, 128 patients were enrolled, with 117 (91.4%) completing the 12-month follow-up. The mean age was 71.3 (SD 4.7) years, with a mean SBP of 136.7 (SD 14.1) mmHg and mean HbA1c of 7.2% (SD 1.0%). There were no significant sociodemographic or clinical differences between groups at baseline. At 12 months, the telemonitoring group experienced significant reductions in SBP (-9.7 mmHg, 95% CI -12.6 to -6.8; P<.001) and HbA1c (-0.5%, 95% CI -0.8 to -0.3; P<.001), whereas the control group exhibited nonsignificant changes in SBP (-2.8 mmHg, 95% CI -5.9 to 0.2; P=.07) and HbA1c (0%, 95% CI -0.3 to 1.9; P=.75). The difference between groups at 12 months was significant for both SBP (-6.9 mmHg, 95% CI -11 to -2.7; P=.001) and HbA1c (-0.5%, 95% CI -0.8 to -0.2; P=.002), with no significant differences observed in secondary outcomes. Telemonitoring effectively improves AH and T2D control in older people but has no impact on other cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes-related quality of life. Future research should explore combining educational and behavioral interventions with telemonitoring to enhance overall health outcomes. However, complex interventions may pose challenges for the elderly, suggesting the need for careful patient selection to ensure that benefits outweigh potential burdens.",

The ANN was trained and tested on FFR recordings, using F0 estimates derived from the spectral domain as input data. Model performance was evaluated by systematically varying the number of inputs, hidden neurons, and the number of sweeps included in the recordings. The prediction accuracy of the ANN was significantly influenced by the number of inputs, hidden neurons, and sweeps. Optimal configurations included 6-8 inputs and 4-6 hidden neurons, achieving a prediction accuracy of approximately 84% when the signal-to-noise ratio was enhanced by including 100 or more sweeps. These results provide a foundation for future applications in auditory processing assessments and clinical diagnostics.",

The model was developed using data from the SUCCESS cohort (n = 494) and externally validated using data from the SECURE trial (n = 1067). Both studies applied identical inclusion criteria for patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. The model was developed using multivariable logistic regression and internally validated using bootstrapping and subsequently validated externally. Model performance was evaluated using discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. A total of 1,561 patients were included of which 1,240 (79.4%) who had received LC after five-year follow-up; 746 of 1,240 patients (70.2%) reported a clinically relevant pain reduction. A multivariable model showed that male sex, increased VAS pain score at baseline, pain radiating to the back, nausea, with absence of obstipation, diarrhea and postprandial bloating were independent predictors for long-term clinically relevant pain reduction. External validation indicated good discrimination and calibration between patients with and without clinically relevant pain reduction (C statistic, 0.75; 95%CI, 0.70-0.79). In this study we developed and validated a model for predicting long-term clinically relevant pain reduction after LC. The model may serve as an instrument to improve patient selection for surgery and may enhance shared decision making.",

A cohort of 129 patients with OUD seeking treatment at an addiction detoxification center underwent detailed clinical assessments. Blood samples were collected for analyses of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein levels, and a complete blood count. Participants were categorized into inflammation and noninflammation groups based on C-reactive protein levels. Hematological and inflammation indices, along with pain severity, were compared between these groups. Significant differences were observed between the inflammation and noninflammation groups on variables such as duration of MOP-r agonist intake, daily buprenorphine/naloxone dose, consumption route, severity of withdrawal symptoms, and level of self-reported pain. The inflammation group exhibited higher neutrophil counts and an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. The binary logistic regression models revealed that self-reported pain level, daily buprenorphine/naloxone dosage, Beck Depression Inventory scores, and age were significant predictors of inflammation. This study contributes to our understanding of OUD as a chronic inflammatory condition, shedding light on the intricate relationships between MOP-r agonist addiction, inflammatory responses, and withdrawal-related parameters. The findings offer valuable perspectives on effective management, emphasizing the need for further research in diverse populations to enhance understanding of this complex condition.",

Twenty-one cases of hyperthermia were identified that were treated using emergency resuscitation and ice-water submersion. All were presumed to have involved the recreational use of psychostimulant drugs. Median initial rectal temperature was 42.2˚C (107.9˚F) (IQR 41.8-42.4˚C). All patients underwent sedation, intubation, and attempted cooling per the event-medicine specific guideline. Eighteen patients were cooled using ice-water submersion and on arrival to the ED the measured mean core temperature was 35.89˚C (96.65˚F) (SD 2.39 ˚C). Three patients did not complete the cooling process as they developed cardiac arrest before or during cooling, necessitating removal from the submersion tank, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), acute resuscitation led by the physician and transport to the closest hospital. On arrival to the ED mean rectal temperature was 35.89˚C (96.65˚F) (SD: 2.39 ˚C). Of the twenty-one patients that met study inclusion, nineteen survived to hospital admission, of which eighteen were discharge from the hospital neurologically intact. A prehospital physician-directed guideline, including ice-water submersion after sedation and intubation, was used in mass gatherings to reduce body temperature in patients with psychostimulant induced hyperthermia. In this case series we present the largest series of patients treated by physician directed guideline in the out of hospital environment at music festivals. Our outcomes suggest that a physician-directed guideline incorporating ice-water immersion on site before transfer to an emergency department can be used to decrease the mortality risk of psychostimulant induced hyperthermia in the prehospital setting.",

      "content": "This study employed a descriptive participatory approach, utilizing data gathered sequentially from 12 Key informant interviews, 4 In-depth interviews and 4 Focus group discussions methods in Bundibugyo district. Interviews used interdisciplinary groups systematically using a SWOT analysis. The research methodology employed an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach allowing participants to articulate their perspectives in their own words. Data analysis was done using both inductive and deductive thematically using NVIVO 12 pro, facilitating the development of codes, sub-themes, and themes. The results of this study prioritized key zoonotic diseases within the district that affect community health. The key themes from these results a) Threats increasing risk of zoonotic spillover, b) Community weaknesses increasing zoonotic diseases occurrence, c) Community strength for zoonotic disease management, prevention and control, d) Opportunities for communities in management of zoonotic diseases. The study emphasizes that political instability, land migration, food insecurity, cultural hunting practices, and climate change act to increase the risk of zoonotic diseases. Complications arise from the mis-identification of diseases due to similar symptoms, and a lack of community education about these diseases. The risk of exposure is influenced by gender roles, with men, who generally interact more with animals, at higher risk. Conversely, women, due to their roles in caring for the sick and involvement in child immunization, are at risk but also play a crucial role in disease control. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for disease management and prevention such as leveraging experienced health workers for disease identification and education, utilizing local communication channels, engaging opinion leaders for effective risk communication, and providing regular training for health workers could address these issues. However, limited funding hinders the execution of recommended strategies such as regular surveillance, tracing of suspected cases, and health register reviews. This study emphasizes the necessity of gender-sensitive approaches in understanding and mitigating zoonotic diseases, advocating for strategies that recognize socio-cultural factors, promote health education, and tailor interventions to provide comprehensive care and protection for all, irrespective of gender.",

Using the established two-sample Mendelian randomization approach, causal relationships have been identified. Shared genetic variants were quantified using a bivariate causal mixture model. Shared loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by conjoint false discovery rate (conjFDR). Gene enrichment and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) were conducted to explore potential transcriptomic associations across tissues. We observed a significant genetic correlation between COPD and frailty (Rg = 0.4324, P = 6.09 × 10 - 26). MiXeR estimated 3,200-shared causal variants. Additionally, we discovered 16 shared loci linked to 91 genes, offering novel insights into gene expression across diverse tissues. The TWAS revealed 25 shared genes, representing a significant advance in understanding the genetic overlap between COPD and frailty. Furthermore, out of the 25 SNPs identified through TWAS, 4 overlapped with the lead SNPs, specifically [HLA-DRB1, PBX3, SLC22A5/OCTN2, SLMAP]. Our study shows a common genetic foundation for COPD and frailty, identifying multiple shared loci and offering insights into their underlying causal connections. These findings enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms linking these conditions and may guide future research and treatment strategies for related diseases.",

      "content": "Since the function of many proteins depends on their ability to assume different stable conformational states, different approaches are required to access these alternative conformations. G-protein-coupled receptors regulate intracellular signaling by assuming two main conformational states: an active state able to bind G-protein and an inactive state. Receptor activation is characterized by large conformational changes at the intracellular region, where the G-protein interacts, accompanied by more subtle structural rearrangements at the extracellular ligand-binding site. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that, for many receptors, the inactive state is the favored conformation generated by AlphaFold2 when the receptor is modeled alone, while active-state structures can only be modeled by introducing a conformational bias in the template information used for the prediction or by explicitly incorporating the binding of a ligand into the modeled system. This benchmarking study extends previous analyses, confirming the opportunities of deep learning tools for modeling G-protein complexed to the active state of receptor, while also revealing limitations in the modeling of allosteric effects, particularly the reduced accuracy of predictions at the receptor extracellular site, which may impact their applicability in structure-based drug design.",

Individuals with aged 5 years or older, and diagnosed as spastic CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I-III were recruited.

Lower extremity range of motion, muscle tone, electromyography, gait profile score (GPS), oxygen consumption was blindly assessed and intention-to-treat analyzed. From 32 eligible patients (16 cases per group), average age was 16.1 ± 9.8 years (group A), and 13.6 ± 5.8 years (group B). Group B demonstrated higher left ankle dorsiflexion than group A (1.7 ± 13.0 degrees vs 12.1 ± 6.9 degrees, P-value = 0.011). GPS slightly improved in Phase I, and contradictory enhanced in TM while deteriorated in PT in Phase II without significant differences between groups. After adjusted for ankle dorsiflexion, TM significantly provided less overall GPS (-1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.6, -0.6), P-value = 0.001), and higher peak activity of right rectus femoris (0.132 mV (95%CI 0.001, 0.262), P-value = 0.030) compared to PT. Other outcomes did not differ significantly between two treatments, and no complication was detected. TM has a positive effect on gait performance, as indicated by GPS and increased activity in the right rectus femoris muscle when compared to PT. A large-scale non-inferiority trial is required to affirm the impact of TM.",

      "content": "Fractal dimension analysis of SEM images reveals that the shale pores of the Shanxi Formation can be divided into organic pores, inter-granular pores and micro-fractures. The average diameter of nano-scale pores is 17.13 nm to 67.65 nm, the surface porosity is 5.75% to 9.37%, and the proportion of micro-fractures is 0.36% to 0.72%, with an average value of 0.53%. The ImageJ Weka Segmentation module in ImageJ software intelligently optimizes the degree of pore recognition in SEM images to ensure accurate extraction and characterization of pore structure features. The fractal dimension of the SEM image was calculated using the Dathe formula for the identified pores: Fractal dimension of bound fluid pore (0.4922 ~ 0.9396) and fractal dimension of movable fluid (2.9727 ~ 2.989), quartz content has a negative correlation with the fractal dimension of bound fluid pores, clay mineral content has a positive correlation with the fractal dimension of bound fluid pores, NMR fractal dimension has no obvious correlation with organic matter content and maturity, and NMR fractal dimension has a negative correlation with porosity, but has no obvious correlation with permeability: indicating that NMR fractal dimension is mainly affected by the composition of shale minerals; The Shanxi Formation shale has a high degree of evolution but the organic matter pores are not developed. The reservoirs space is mainly provided by inter-granular pores and micro-fractures; the inter-granular pores and micro-fractures have high heterogeneity and poor connectivity leads to low permeability. This paper attempts to use the ImageJ Weka Segmentation module to intelligently optimize the identification of pores, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of pore identification. At the same time, it combines the fractal dimension of SEM images and the fractal dimension of NMR images to characterize reservoir characteristics, which provides a basis for quantitatively describing the irregularity of shale pore morphology.",

However, there is significant variability in the impact of these three pathways on firm performance. These pathways collectively exemplify the concept of \"different paths, same destination, yet diverse effects\". Sample enterprises exhibit inadequate investment in digital technology innovation; enterprise size, executives' risk appetite and government support intensity emerge as significant facilitators of the digital transformation process within pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, while technological integration capabilities positively enhance the effectiveness of this transformation; An overreliance on the external environment will constrain the innovation autonomy of pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises during digital transformation and hinder the scale effects of these enterprises. The conclusion offers pragmatic guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises without digital technology innovation capabilities to select suitable digital transformation strategies to enhance enterprise performance.",

Main outcome parameters were age of disease onset, diagnostic delay and survival. Clinical characteristics and potential associations between biochemical parameters and clinical outcome (i.e. age of disease onset, survival) were explored. The median survival period of the study cohort was 60 months. ISOD typically presented shortly after birth with a median age of onset of 3 days. Median age at diagnosis was 10 months, leading to a substantial median diagnostic delay of 5.7 months. Homocysteine concentrations in plasma correlated with age of disease onset. An association of biochemical parameters of cysteine metabolism and survival could not be identified. The present analysis describes long-term outcome measures adding to the quantitative understanding of the natural history of ISOD, which might be helpful in the planning of prospective clinical trials and potentially stimulate development of targeted therapies in the future.",

This meta-analysis examines PD-L1 positivity rates in BTC and association between PD-L1 expression and outcomes in patients treated with chemo-ICI. Observational studies or clinical trials reporting tissue-based PD-L1 expression by Tumor Proportional Score/Combined Positive Score using immunohistochemistry were included. Clinical trials of BTC treated with chemo-ICI were included to assess PD-L1 expression on treatment response. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies before November 15, 2023. Methods of PD-L1 assessment, including antibody clone, cutoff for PD-L1 positivity, and anatomical subtype, were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and objective response rates (ORRs) were the main outcomes. The generic inverse variance method and random-effect model were used to assess pooled effect sizes. Fifty-six studies met eligibility criteria. Among 7,768 patients, pooled PD-L1 positivity was 30%. Positivity rates varied significantly by antibody clone (5H1, 58% <i>v</i> SP142, 17%; <i>P</i> = .02). Clinical trials reported a higher positivity rate compared with observational studies (48% <i>v</i> 26%; <i>P</i> < .01). Across five phase I/II clinical trials (194 patients), PD-L1 ≥1% patients tended to have a better ORR than PD-L1 <1% patients (64% <i>v</i> 46%; <i>P</i> = .08). In two randomized controlled trials (874 patients), PD-L1 ≥1% had a statistically significant improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; <i>P</i> < .01), while PD-L1 <1% did not (HR, 0.85; <i>P</i> = .2). Given the high PD-L1 positivity rate seen in this study, as well as a possible signal of predictive response for chemo-ICI treatment, PD-L1 expression should be further explored as a predictive biomarker.",

      "content": "The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is contributed by B lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular enzyme within these cells that modulates their inflammatory properties. Thus, central nervous system-penetrant inhibitors of BTK may counter immune dysregulation, and this aspiration is highlighted by 11 phase 3 clinical trials in MS to inhibit this enzyme. Despite the keen interest, the spatial and temporal elevation of BTK in lesions of MS and its models is not well characterized. We used quantitative fluorescence immunohistology to assess the expression of BTK and a phosphorylated activated form in different lesion types of MS and 3 of its models: inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), toxin-induced demyelination of lysolecithin, and oxidized phosphatidylcholine injuries. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib), a BTK inhibitor in phase 3 clinical trials in MS, was evaluated in EAE for its capacity to alter disease course. We observed low expression of BTK and a phosphorylated form (pBTK) in murine spinal cord but significant upregulation in white matter lesions inflicted by oxidized phosphatidylcholine, lysolecithin, and EAE. Expression predominantly localized to microglia/macrophages shown through colocalization analysis by Imaris 3-dimensional rendering. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib) significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE when administered prophylactically and marginally ameliorated disability when initiated from onset of clinical disability.",

In the inactive core of chronic active MS lesions, the few remaining HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells were still BTK immunoreactive. Our results demonstrate that BTK immunoreactivity is normally undetectable in uninjured areas or normal-appearing white matter of human and murine CNS, but that expression becomes prominent in lesions with hypercellular aggregates of microglia and macrophages. Staining for pBTK reveals that its upregulation declines in the later stage of lysolecithin and chronic stage of EAE injury while BTK upregulation is maintained. Our collective results support the rationale of using brain-penetrant BTK inhibitors to modulate the elevation of this enzyme in microglia/macrophages within inflamed plaques of MS.",

However, the potential link between such genetic defects and the development of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains unclear. We conducted whole-exome sequencing on 100 (N = 100) tumor-normal paired and orphan tumor samples of PTC from Indian patients, characterizing both germline and somatic molecular alterations. We identified significant germline mutations in the <i>DUOX2</i> gene (approximately 8.8%), commonly associated with congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dyshormonogenesis, and found these mutations to correlate with poor prognosis in PTC. Additionally, hallmark somatic mutations were detected in genes such as <i>BRAF</i> (35.4%), <i>KRAS</i> (3.8%), <i>HRAS</i> (5.1%), and <i>NRAS</i> (17.7%), which are well-known drivers of PTC. Importantly, we identified a distinct molecular subtype termed independent of BRAF-RAS (iBR), characterized by nonhallmark alterations and associated with a higher recurrence rate and poorer recurrence-free survival in Indian patients with PTC, highlighting the clinical significance of these molecular insights in prognosis and treatment strategies. Our analysis of PTC among Indians revealed novel genetic alterations and molecular subtypes. We identified a germline mutation in the <i>DUOX2</i> gene, associated with congenital hypothyroidism, as a potential risk factor of PTC. Additionally, we characterized distinct molecular subtypes, <i>BRAF-RAS</i> driven and iBR driven, and their clinical implications.",

Dual-phase alloys are known for their exceptional balance between strength and ductility. In this study, phase transformations were strategically induced in the BCC single-phase nanograined (NG) Fe-Ni alloy synthesized via inert gas condensation (IGC). Aging at 300 °C resulted in the formation of a BCC-FCC (body-center cubic and face-center cubic) dual-phase structure. Microcompression experiments revealed that the NG Fe-Ni alloy annealed for 10 h achieved an ultrahigh yield strength of 4800 MPa, approaching the theoretical strength, while maintaining considerable ductility of 24%. Phase transformation promoted dislocation exhaustion during prolonged annealing, which contributes to the ultrahigh strength of the Fe-Ni alloy.",

      "content": "Twenty-seven players of a women's national soccer team volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects were tested at 3-time points (i.e., time-point 1, time-point 2, and time-point 3) for body composition (sum of 6 skinfolds [∑6SF] measures), maximal dynamic strength (i.e., squat 1 repetition maximum [squat 1RM]), countermovement jump (CMJ), and 10-m sprint performance. Our results demonstrated substantial improvements in body composition (i.e., reduced ∑6SF and fat mass percentage and increased muscle mass percentage [MM%]), strength (i.e., enhanced absolute and relative squat 1RM), speed and jump performance (i.e., decreased sprint times and increased CMJ height) (p < 0.001; effect size: very large) at the different time points. Post hoc analyses revealed that all measured parameters varied significantly from TP1 to TP2 and TP3 (p: 0.006 to <0.001), except for MM% and CMJ height between TP1 and TP2 (p > 0.299). In conclusion, these findings highlight the effectiveness of the 4-month training period in enhancing the overall performance of the female soccer players. Furthermore, it is plausible to suggest that the changes in anthropometric and body composition parameters were directly related to the improvements observed in physical performance measures.",

Characteristics of resistance training programs targeting improvements in health outcomes in postmenopausal women: A scoping review. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-Currently there are no evidence-based recommendations for health-promoting resistance training programs specifically for postmenopausal women. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the characteristics of resistance training programs targeting health-related outcomes in postmenopausal women. Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL, were searched using both controlled language and keyword searches. A total of 790 studies were screened and 69 studies met the eligibility criteria. The studies incorporated a full-body resistance training protocol (n = 52), training for specific muscle group or body part, such as back extensors (n = 13), or aquatic resistance training (n = 4). Most commonly used dose was 3 sets of 8 repetitions (n = 8) or 3 sets of 10 repetitions (n = 7). Intensity was typically described as 80% of 1 repetition maximum or as 8 repetition maximum. In the full body training programs, most common exercises were leg extensions (n = 35), leg press (n = 35), and chest press (n = 33). Most commonly measured health-related outcomes were body size and composition (n = 33) or muscular performance (n = 32). The results of this scoping review demonstrate that studies targeting to improve health-related outcomes in postmenopausal women follow the established strength training guidelines but typically do not incorporate functional exercises. Functional exercises can be important for maintaining the ability to perform common daily activities, such as carrying groceries and lifting heavy household items.",

Trends in mean hand grip strength, cutoff value, and prevalence of low hand grip strength: An analysis of 2014-2019 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) defines probable sarcopenia as low muscle strength detected by hand grip strength (HGS). According to this guideline, cutoff for low HGS is determined using a T-score of -2.5 based on age group showing the highest HGS (aged 30-39 years). Our hypothesis is that temporal changes in mean HGS of Koreans may lead to changes in the cutoff values for low HGS and the prevalence of probable sarcopenia as defined by the EWGSOP2 guidelines. We analyzed trends of HGS using 6 years of Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We used the EWGSOP2 guidelines to set yearly cutoff values for low HGS and calculated the prevalence of low HGS. The cutoff value for low HGS and the prevalence rate of low HGS in individuals aged 70 years or older were analyzed using linear regression and trend analysis. We observed a significant decreasing trend from 2014 to 2019 in annual cutoff values for low HGS, ranging from 24.5 to 30.9 kg in men and 13.1-17.3 kg in women. Correspondingly, the prevalence of low HGS (probable sarcopenia) varied significantly from 10.4 to 34.2% in men and 9.1-20.8% in women, indicating notable year-to-year fluctuations (p < 0.001). While pooling multiyear data reduces some variability, it does not fully address fluctuations in prevalence of probable sarcopenia.",

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-The purpose of this investigation was to examine changes in performance capacity in repeated all-out efforts. Ten participants (24.00 ± 4.32 years, 79.71 ± 46.05 kg, 1.79 ± 0.102 m) completed a maximal treadmill test with direct breath-by-breath and heart rate (HR) analysis to capture maximal aerobic capacity (V̇o2peak, mL·kg-1·minute-1) and HR (HRPEAK-TM, bpm). Participants also completed three 30-meter shuttle sprint 3-minutes all-out test (3 MT) bouts, from which critical velocity (CV, m·second-1), anaerobic work capacity (D', m), maximal sprint speed (SMAX, m·second-1), and the difference between SMAX and CV (SMAX-CV, m·second-1) were calculated. The 30-second end-3MT average HR (HREND-3MT, bpm), pretest blood lactate (LA-PRE, mmol·L-1), and post-test blood lactate (LA-POST, mmol·L-1) captured physiologic responses to the 3 MT session. Repeated measures ANOVAs (⍺ = 0.05) indicated that CV (F = 1.401, p = 0.270) did not significantly change across bouts, but D' (F = 7.271, p = 0.005) and SMAX (F = 7.474, p = 0.004) significantly decreased across bouts. HREND-3MT was significantly lower than HRPEAK-TM (F = 11.961, p < 0.001), and the LA-POST did not significantly change across bouts (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that V̇o2peak was significantly related to CV in bout 1 (r = 0.745, p = 0.013) and bout 3 (r = 0.746, p = 0.013). CV may be a repeatable level of performance but the ability to work more than the CV is significantly diminished in repeated all-out efforts.",

Relative values of maximal isometric strength in lower limbs across different sports disciplines in high-performance athletes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-This study aimed to establish reference values for relative strength in lower limb dynamometry among high-performance athletes across various sports disciplines and to compare the differences in relative strength between these disciplines. In total, 297 elite athletes (female athletes:155; male athletes:142) from 26 different sports participated, grouped into categories such as team sports, gymnastics, combat sports, racket sports, endurance, power track and field, weightlifting, and other. Relative strength was measured using a dynamometer through maximal isometric contractions. Knee extension and ankle plantar flexion were the tests with the highest strength application in both sexes, while external hip rotation and hip abduction showed the least force application. Analysis of variance revealed differences based on the test and sports discipline (p < 0.05). Female athletes showed differences in hip abduction, hip extension, hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, and ankle plantar flexion, with gymnastic sports demonstrating greater strength, particularly compared with team sports and endurance. In male athletes (p < 0.05), endurance sports showed lower strength in external hip rotation compared with racket sports, and in hip abduction compared with combat sports. The agonist-antagonist ratio indicated greater strength in internal hip rotation, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion in both sexes, and hip abduction in female athletes and hip adduction in male athletes, compared with their antagonists. Significant differences were found in the hip adduction-abduction and ankle plantar-dorsal flexion ratio in gymnastics compared with the rest of sports.",

      "content": "Covalent binders that target lysine residues are increasingly reported. Covalent binding to lysine involves challenges such as the increased p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of the side chain and its considerable flexibility. Here, we describe two computational methods to derivatize lysine-binding covalent small-molecules based on known noncovalent binders, approaching the design problem from two opposite directions. In a \"ligand-side\" approach, we scan different ligand positions to install an electrophile and dock these derivatized ligands into the target protein. In a \"protein-side\" approach, we install an electrophile on the target lysine and model its conformational space to find suitable installation vectors on the ligand. We applied both of these protocols retrospectively to a data set of electrophilic ligands and to a data set of vitamin B6 covalently bound to a receptor lysine residue. Our ligand-side protocol successfully identified the known covalent binder in 80% and 86% of cases, while the protein-side protocol achieved identification rates of 56% and 82%, respectively. We prospectively validated these protocols by designing and testing a new lysine-targeting MKK7 inhibitor. Mass-spectrometry and crystallography validated the covalent binding to the target lysine. Applying these protocols to a data set of known kinase inhibitors identified high-confidence covalent candidates for more than 200 human kinases, demonstrating the potential impact of our protocols.",

Is countermovement jump height and one repetition maximum back squat associated with the peak force of a front kick with and without carried load? J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-The front kick is a fundamental technique used in self-defense and hand to hand combat. This study aimed to test whether front kick performance, both with and without a 30-kg carried load, can be effectively estimated or tracked through commonly available testing procedures such as the countermovement jumps (CMJ) and one repetition maximum back squat (1RM BS). In 2 testing sessions, 21 male participants (mean age = 22.7 years, SD = 1.9) performed 1RM BS, 5 front kicks peak force (FK) without and with 30-kg carried load (FK30), and 3 CMJ without and with 30-kg carried load (CMJ30). A force plate measured the peak force (N) of the FK and FK30 and the height (cm) of the CMJ and CMJ30. Statistically significant correlations were found between CMJ and FK (r = 0.55 [0.225-1], p = 0.005) and CMJ and 1RM BS (r = 0.54 [0.219-1, p = 0.005]). Carried load reduced both CMJ height by 61% (d = 3.35 [2.543-∞], p < 0.001) and FK peak force by 23% (d = 1.33 [0.828-∞], p < 0.001), compared without load condition. A regression model using 1RM BS and CMJ explained 31.5% of FK variance, with only the height of CMJ being statistically significantly associated, β = 0.626, p = 0.015. The study demonstrates that although there is a relationship between explosive power and maximum strengths, FK is more related to CMJ height than 1RM BS.",

The training load was monitored using a mobile gas analyzer, heart rate monitors, and blood lactate measurements. The total energy expenditure (TEE) (classified as the sum of oxidative [OES], glycolytic [GC], and excess postexercise energy cost [EPOC]) was estimated using the V̇o2 consumption (at rest, during exercise, and postexercise) and blood lactate (La) concentration (at rest and postexercise). The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. All exercises were associated with a low-to-moderate physiological strain (rate of perceived exertion: 7.3-12.3; % of maximal heart rate: 52.3-61.7%; METs: 2.6-3.7; La: 2.2-3.9 mM; EPOC duration: 5.7-7.8 minutes), with the OS and the SLS associated with the greatest physiological/metabolic load in both trials. T45 induced a greater heart rate (53.7-61.7 %HRmax), with SLS and OS inducing the highest values. Minimal differences were noted between T30 and T45 for TEE, MET, and La values for most. EPOC had a greater contribution to TEE compared with OES and GC. Low-to moderate physiological effort during ST results in a TEE of 16.6-24.7 and 20.1-30 kcal·min-1 when performed for 30 and 45 seconds, respectively. There is a variation in TEE and physiological overload among ST exercises. Weight management exercise programs and dietary regimens need to take these finding into account.",

      "content": "Central to this narrative is Isolde the Fair, whose beauty is portrayed as both otherworldly and divine. Her allure transcends mere physical appearance, embodying an idealized, mythical beauty that surpasses human boundaries. Isolde's beauty is often depicted through features such as golden hair, pale skin, and symmetrical facial proportions, aligning with classical ideals of attractiveness. These attributes not only highlight her physical perfection but also suggest a spiritual allure, elevating her to a near-divine status. This portrayal serves as a catalyst for the tragic love affair between her and Tristan, a knight. Their love, ignited by a potent love potion, defies societal norms and moral conventions, ultimately leading to their downfall. The depiction of Isolde's beauty reflects medieval cultural ideals, where physical perfection was often associated with moral and spiritual superiority. Her radiant attributes symbolize an unattainable standard of femininity, contributing to the narrative's exploration of love, fate, and tragedy. This idealization of beauty has parallels in contemporary society's pursuit of physical perfection, as seen in modern aesthetic practices and the ongoing cultural emphasis on appearance. Isolde the Fair embodies the medieval archetype of idealized beauty, serving as both an object of desire and a symbol of the perilous allure of perfection. Her portrayal in the legend offers insight into historical and ongoing cultural perceptions of beauty and its profound impact on human experience.",

Sex differences were found in PC2 (p = 0.039) and PC3 (p = 0.002) for ruck, and PC3 (p < 0.01) for endurance course revealing greater demands in women. Tactical mobility requires greater biomechanical and physiological demands than load carriage and places greater demands on women.

These findings indicate that, despite a significant (albeit small) difference between CP and MMSSest, the CP model provided a close approximation of the PO associated with MMSSest in both untrained and trained participants, as the difference in PO was within the expected measurement error. Therefore, our results showed that, despite some small discrepancies between groups, the CP model fitting was not affected by training status and that previous testing experience with highly demanding exercise is not a key component of the quality of the prediction model.",

This study initiates the first proteomic analysis of lactylation in both wild-type (ZYD) and cultivated-type (SN14) soybeans. We established the first global lysine lactylation proteome profile in soybean seeds, identifying 783 Kla sites across 327 proteins. Our analysis revealed that the wild variety showed higher levels of protein content, lactate content, and lactylation levels. Moreover, we observed distinct Kla patterns between wild and cultivated soybeans, primarily affecting the lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Intriguingly, our results showed that metabolites associated with oil biosynthesis were downregulated in wild soybeans, while proteins linked to storage protein pathways were significantly upregulated, suggesting that Kla may play a role in negatively regulating the oil content while enhancing the protein content in soybean seeds. Taken together, this research provides the first comprehensive evidence of lactylation in soybeans and suggests its role in regulating oil and protein content in seeds. The findings open new avenues for improving soybean seed quality through targeted metabolic engineering and breeding strategies.",

Each age group was further subdivided into 2 cohorts: the flexible laryngeal mask group and the tracheal intubation group, each comprising 30 children. Parameters such as operation duration, anesthesia recovery time, and postoperative complications, such as coughing, laryngospasm, laryngeal edema, were monitored and recorded. In addition, agitation scores during recovery, consciousness levels, and intraoperative air leakage were also documented. In the 1-to-3-year age group, a statistically significant difference was observed in both operation duration and recovery time between the 2 groups. Specifically, the operation duration was significantly longer in the laryngeal mask group compared with the tracheal intubation group (P < 0.05), whereas the recovery time was shorter in the laryngeal mask group (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in other indicators between the 2 groups. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in any of the measured indicators between the laryngeal mask group and the tracheal intubation group in 4-to-6-year and 7-to 12-year age groups. The use of a flexible laryngeal mask in children older than 3 years demonstrates minimal adverse reactions and good efficacy, supporting its broader application in clinical practice.",

Fracture reduction was simulated on the models to plan titanium plate configuration (number, shape) and surgical approaches. Intraoperative reduction followed model-guided protocols. Postoperative 3-month CT scans measured anatomic landmark distances (bilateral Co-Go, Fr-Fr'/N-Me) to assess reduction accuracy. Patient-reported outcomes were quantified using the FACE-Q scale across 4 domains: appearance satisfaction, health-related quality of life, postoperative function, and adverse events. The 3D model demonstrated submillimeter-level accuracy, with a 0.1±0.12 mm discrepancy (P>0.05) compared with 3-month postoperative data and bilateral symmetry error ≤0.5 mm (AO standard compliant). At 3 months, bony landmark stability improved significantly (64% reduction in positional SD versus preoperative, P<0.001). FACE-Q total scores increased from 45.2±8.1 preoperatively to 90.4±3.6 postoperatively (Δ+45.2, P<0.001; Cohen d=6.5), with marked improvements in appearance-related distress (Δ+55.8), respiratory function (Δ+52.2), and social function (Δ+54.7). Strong positive correlations emerged between anatomic precision and FACE-Q scores (r=0.78-0.85, P<0.01), showing that each 0.1 mm reduction in zygomaticofrontal suture error increased facial symmetry scores by 8.3 points (β=0.72, P=0.003). Preoperative 3D model simulation enables submillimeter-accurate anatomic reconstruction of cranio-maxillofacial fractures while concurrently optimizing physiological function and psychological well-being. This technique harmonizes anatomic reliability with patient-centered benefits, establishing an evidence-based paradigm for individualized complex trauma management.",

Furthermore, the introduction of hydrogen-bonding constraints modifies ligand flexibility and adaptive capacity, thereby redirecting self-sorting pathways toward distinct supramolecular outcomes. This study lays a foundation for advancing the field of systems chemistry, emphasizing the potential for developing multistage assembly cascades.",

The level of metabolism-related RNA expression significantly decreased with walking habits compared to no walking habits. Studies in mice have revealed a direct link between circulating WBC and endothelium/satellite cells via gap junction.

Increased age was associated with reporting feeling less negative at the time of the event, and also remembering feeling more positive (elated and happy) when reconstructing the event one year later.

Decoding the vast repeatome is an exciting frontier being enabled by recent technological advancements. However, identifying the extent of meaningful information in repeats will likely require concepts that go well beyond impacts for individual genes, to new ways to identify and interpret broad patterns of genome-wide organization and nucleus-wide regulation.",

However, compounds in this series were shown to have poor microsomal stability and high plasma protein binding. Despite these limitations, the exceptional selectivity profile of these compounds makes them valuable tool compounds for investigating D4 receptor signaling in cellular models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. These findings provide important structural insights for the future development of metabolically stable D4 receptor antagonists for therapeutic applications.",

      "content": "However, experiments are often difficult to interpret, and the development of computationally affordable approaches to simulate experimental signals is desirable. For linear spectroscopy, optical spectra of small to medium-sized molecules can be efficiently calculated in the Franck-Condon approach. Approximating the nuclear degrees of freedom as harmonic around the ground- and excited-state minima, closed-form expressions for the exact finite-temperature linear response function can be derived using known solutions for the propagation operator between normal mode coordinate sets, fully accounting for Duschinsky mode-mixing effects. In the present work, we demonstrate that a similar approach can be utilized to yield analogous closed-form expression for the finite-temperature nonlinear (third-order) response function of harmonic nuclear Hamiltonians. The resulting approach, named FC2DES, is implemented on graphics processing units, allowing efficient computations of 2DES signals for medium-sized molecules containing hundreds of normal modes. Benchmark comparisons against the widely used cumulant method for computing 2DES signals are performed on small model systems, as well as the nile red molecule. We highlight the advantages of the FC2DES approach, especially in systems with moderate Duschinsky mode mixing and for long delay times in the nonlinear response function, where low-order cumulant approximations are shown to fail.",

      "content": "However, its emphasis on individual-level factors may obscure the role of structural and systemic influences. This is significant for the US context, given US histories of pronounced structural racism and economic inequality. This study extends the social defeat hypothesis by examining established indicators of social defeat, along with US-specific factors that capture structural influences on individuals' perceptions of discrimination and exclusion as defeatist. Data from the National Survey of Poly-victimization and Mental Health (N = 1 584) were analyzed to investigate cross-sectional associations between individual-level and structural indicators of marginalization and social defeat and self-reported PEs among young adults. BIPOC participants had 60% higher odds of reporting PEs in the past year (OR = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.03; P = .003). Furthermore, participants with at least 1 experience of police violence in the past year have 52% higher odds of reporting PEs (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00; P = .003). Several additional indicators were associated with increased odds of PE, including race (non-White compared to White), high-frequency substance use, everyday discrimination, exposure to childhood abuse or bullying. Findings align with European social defeat literature, confirming the relevance of the hypothesis in the US context. However, prominence of structural factors (racism, police violence) suggests that the social defeat hypothesis should incorporate systemic influences, emphasizing the need for interventions addressing societal contributors to psychosis risk.",

SettingParticipants were recruited through institutional and professional networks and provided with standardized questions derived from authoritative treatment guidelines. SubjectsTwenty-six psychiatrists participated, and ChatGPT-4o responses were generated using a standardized prompt for each question. MeasuresTwo independent psychiatrists evaluated accuracy and conciseness using a blinded rating system. Readability was assessed with the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level test, and clarity was measured with the Writing Clarity Index Calculator. AnalysisThe Shapiro-Wilk test assessed normality. Paired t-tests were used for normally distributed data, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data. Statistical significance was set at <i>P</i> < .05. ResultsChatGPT-4o showed comparable accuracy to psychiatrists (<i>P</i> = .0645) but was significantly more concise (<i>P</i> = .0019). Readability differences were not statistically significant (<i>P</i> = .0892), while psychiatrists provided clearer responses (<i>P</i> = .0059).

      "content": "This study aimed to develop a non-insulin version of the DEPS-R and evaluate its screening performance for BED in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The DEPS-R was reduced to 10 non-insulin-specific items (DEPS-10). As part of the ongoing pro-mental study, 679 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes completed the baseline survey and took part in diagnostic interviews to assess BED. The screening performance of the DEPS-10 was tested via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared with DEPS-R and food-related items of the Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID). N = 24 participants (total = 3.5%; type 1 = 2.9%, type 2 = 4.3%) were diagnosed with a current BED. The DEPS-10 performed well in screening for BED (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.92, p < 0.001) comparable with the DEPS-R (AUC = 0.92, p < 0.001) and exceeded the performance of food-related PAID items (AUC = 0.82, p < 0.001). A cut-off score of ≥15 showed optimal sensitivity and specificity in BED screening. People who met the cut-off had significantly higher BMI and HbA1c and more diabetes distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms. DEPS-10 is a reliable screening instrument for BED. Its associations with glycaemic and mental health outcomes reflect its good construct validity comparable to DEPS-R.",

Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5<sup>ASB7</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, thereby ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.",

However, probing subsurface inter- and intramolecular properties of polymers remains a significant challenge with conventional AFM techniques, such as tapping mode. In this study, we utilized torsional force spectroscopy on annealed polystyrene-<i>block</i>-polybutadiene (SB) diblock copolymer films, which consist of rigid polystyrene (PS) cylinders embedded in a softer polybutadiene (PB) matrix, to analyze their inter- and intramolecular interactions as a function of the AFM tip indentation depth. The slow cantilever dynamics in torsional force spectroscopy along the <i>z</i>-direction allows for greater indentation depths compared to tapping mode, facilitating deeper tip penetration into the SB polymer films.",

      "content": "This approach enables a precise analysis of the molecular interactions between the AFM tip and the PS and PB polymer blocks. By converting the available observables, such as torsional frequency shift and torsional excitation amplitude, into mechanical quantities, specifically in-plane tip-sample force, shear stress, and the dissipated energy between the lateral tip motion and the polymer blocks, we determined their dependence on the block alignment relative to the tip trajectory. We found that PS cylinders exhibit considerable rigidity when subjected to shear along their length axis with an AFM tip. In contrast, when shear stress is applied perpendicular to the length axis, the PS cylinders can wobble in the softer PB matrix. Additionally, we observed that the molecular interactions of individual molecules within the PS cylinders are approximately 0.22 pN. Our findings highlight the capability of torsional force spectroscopy to visualize local nanomechanical properties and to reveal the differences in inter- and intramolecular interactions within polymeric films. This insight can significantly contribute to the design of functional nanomaterials by providing a deeper understanding of molecular interactions on the nanometer scale.",

      "content": "Glaciers adapt slowly to changing climatic conditions, with long-term implications for sea-level rise and water supply. Using eight glacier models, we simulated global glacier evolution over multicentennial timescales, allowing glaciers to equilibrate with climate under various constant global temperature scenarios. We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7°C by 2100 above preindustrial).",
