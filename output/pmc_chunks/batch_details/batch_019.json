      "content": "The ongoing global outbreak of mpox has highlighted an urgent need to understand the environmental stability of MPXV. This study investigates the stability of MPXV on surfaces encountered in clinical settings. The persistence of viable MPXV and viral DNA was evaluated using porous (gauze, cotton, and scrubs), and nonporous (stainless steel, polypropylene plastic, intravenous tubing, N95 masks, and nitrile gloves) materials. Surfaces were inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, and 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) MPXV and incubated at room temperature (22 °C) and 4 °C for up to 21 days to determine the effect of temperature and inoculum titre on virus viability. We show that MPXV stability is influenced by both surface type and temperature, with nonporous surfaces and lower temperatures supporting longer virus viability. Infectious MPXV was detected for up to 21 days on intravenous tubing and nitrile gloves at 4 °C, whereas porous materials like cotton showed rapid loss of infectivity, especially at room temperature. Notably, we found that viral DNA did not correlate with the presence of infectious virus, suggesting that molecular assays may overestimate fomite-mediated transmission risks. Our findings provide novel insights into MPXV persistence in clinical environments, extending prior knowledge by systematically quantifying virus viability across multiple surface types and temperature conditions. These findings underscore the importance of stringent decontamination protocols in clinical settings and highlight the need for comprehensive methods for risk assessment to evaluate the potential for MPXV transmission from contaminated surfaces.",

      "content": "Understanding syphilis epidemiology will inform screening and treatment programs. However, such data are lacking in many communities. We outline a population-based syphilis screening program in a rural community in southwestern Uganda to describe the population prevalence of syphilis. In June 2019 we conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study of adults >18 years of age. Two-stage syphilis testing was completed with <i>Treponema pallidum</i> hemagglutination (TPHA) rapid immunochromatographic testing, confirmed by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) in those with positive TPHA (syphilis seroprevalence). We calculate inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weights using logistic regression to estimate the population prevalence of positive TPHA. We included covariates with a univariable α = .10 in multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by sex, to estimate correlates of syphilis seroprevalence. Among 749 participants who participated in this population-based study, 724 (97%) completed syphilis screening. The median age was 42.9 years (standard deviation, 15.6 years) and 456 of 724 (63%) were women. Based on the IPT-weighted adjusted model, the syphilis population seroprevalence was 10.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.4%-13.4%). Among the 62 of 79 (78%) participants who completed RPR testing, all had titers ≤1:4. Syphilis seroprevalence was associated with less education, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and ≥2 sexual partners in the prior month among women and with HIV among men. We describe a high prevalence of current or former syphilis (10.6%) in a population-based study in rural Uganda. Syphilis screening and surveillance programs in this region require expansion to capture populations not routinely in care.",

      "content": "Overall, the propensity for nodal and distant metastases is low, but spread throughout the lungs is frequent. The radiographic \"ground glass\" presentation makes differentiation between infectious and inflammatory consolidations challenging, and the diagnosis of malignancy is often unexpected. A 50-year-old patient underwent double lung transplantation (LTx) in July 2018 for progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD). IMA was unexpectedly found in the explant lungs. Pre-transplant PET-CT scans suggested inflammatory ILD without malignancy. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration of the enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes demonstrated no evidence of malignancy. Post-transplant pathology confirmed stage IVA IMA with a KRAS G12D mutation. After 3 years, recurrent IMA was detected. The asymptomatic patient remains under close surveillance with stable lung function, and tailored treatment will be considered if progression occurs. IMA is currently rarely considered an indication for LTx. The risk of recurrence after transplantation is substantial, and recurrence negatively impacts long-term post-transplant prognosis. Incidental adenocarcinoma in explant lungs will remain a complication of imperfect transplant recipient selection. A high index of suspicion of disease recurrence in the donor lungs should be maintained in these patients. Further research is required to understand the optimal screening, treatment, and follow-up of these patients.",

ADRs were categorized by severity and follow-up status, and further classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, specifying the Preferred Terms and the related System Organ Classes. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and univariate and multiple logistic regression identified potential risk factors for ADR onset. Backward Stepwise logistic regression (BSLR) was used to determine independent variables associated with ADR occurrence. The nintedanib group had more frequent ADRs related to gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disorders, with nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss as the most common. The pirfenidone group had more ADRs related to skin, nervous system, and vascular disorders, such as rash, nausea, dizziness, and blood pressure imbalances. Significant baseline differences between groups included age, smoking status, FVC (%), DLCO (%), and 6-MWT, with the nintedanib cohort showing worse baseline characteristics. A total of 450 ADRs were reported: 59.6% for nintedanib and 40.4% for pirfenidone. Independent variables that significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing ADR were drug change, treatment type, gender, and age. Identifying ADR predictors is essential for personalizing treatment strategies. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib are crucial in managing IPF, highlighting the need for further research to optimize personalized therapies and patient outcomes.",

      "content": "This age-associated increase contributes significantly to healthcare burdens by elevating risks of disability, frailty, and mortality. Despite its profound impact, current clinical approaches to sarcopenia remain limited. While resistance exercise and protein supplementation form the cornerstone of management, their efficacy is often constrained by poor long-term adherence and variable individual responses, highlighting the urgent need for more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and influenced by various factors, including aging, inflammation, nutritional deficits, physical inactivity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are still not fully understood. Recent research has made significant strides in elucidating the intricate mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, revealing novel insights into its molecular and cellular underpinnings. Notably, emerging evidence points to the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered myokine profiles, and neuromuscular junction degeneration in sarcopenia progression. Additionally, breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, exosome-based treatments, and precision nutrition offer promising avenues for clinical intervention. This review aims to synthesize the latest advancements in sarcopenia research, focusing on the novel contributions to its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. We explore emerging trends such as the role of cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation, and targeted therapeutic interventions that could reshape future approaches to managing sarcopenia. By highlighting recent breakthroughs and cutting-edge research, we hope to advance the understanding of sarcopenia and foster the translation of these findings into effective clinical therapies.",

Understanding the potential relationship of the greater trochanter to patient demographics may provide an opportunity to improve implant placement. Retrospective review of x-ray and computed tomography images of the proximal femur was performed. Inclusion criteria consisted of skeletally mature patients over 18 years old with imaging of the proximal femur. Inclusion criteria identified 296 patients. Mean age of included patients was 34 ± 20 years. Average greater trochanter height was 40 ± 8.1 mm. Mean caput-collum-diaphyseal angle was 141 ± 8.6 degrees. After identifying significant factors using univariate analyses a multivariable linear regression demonstrated that patient height and caput-collum-diaphyseal angle were statistically significant predictors for greater trochanter height. For every 1 cm increase in patient height there was a predicted 0.11 mm increase in greater trochanter height (<i>p</i>=0.01). Conversely, every 1 degree increase in caput-collum-diaphyseal angle results in an associated 0.17 mm decrease in greater trochanter height (<i>p</i> < 0.001). This study provides information that may allow for the potential optimization of implant design or implant position to minimize proximal nail protrusion, enhance nail fit and ensure cephalomedullary lag screw position in the head based on the proximal nail dimensions of the implant used.",

Load significantly increased AC, IEMG, RMS% and MPF of lower limb muscles (P < 0.01). The interaction effect of duration and load had no significant difference on PP, MP, IEMG, RMS% and MPF (P > 0.05), but increased on Fl (P < 0.05).

      "content": "Disuse muscle atrophy is a deleterious effect of joint immobilization, which is used as a conservative treatment for bone, muscle, and joint injuries and promotes a significant functional decline. Physical exercise is an effective therapeutic modality in combating muscle atrophy, especially resistance training that promotes hypertrophic responses. We aimed to investigate the plasticity of the MTJ in rats subjected to joint immobilization, followed by resistance training in a short period (7 and 14 days). Forty-eight male <i>Wistar</i> rats (90 days old) were used and divided into groups (<i>n</i> = 8): Control (C), Immobilized (I), Trained (T), and Immobilized Trained (IT). The MTJ samples of gastrocnemius muscle were collected and processed for morphoquantitative analyses using transmission electron microscopy (MTJ and sarcomeres morphometry) and immunofluorescence techniques for collagen XXII, satellite cells and telocytes. We observed that the I group exhibited a reduction in muscle mass, which was associated with a decrease in the length of sarcoplasmic invaginations and evaginations, as well as reductions in belly and proximal sarcomere length. Conversely, the IT groups demonstrated a progressive increase in muscle mass, with significant improvements from 7 days (<i>p</i> < 0.01) to 14 days (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The most pronounced adaptations in sarcoplasmic projections were observed in the IT14 group, which exhibited: a significant increase in the length of sarcoplasmic invaginations (<i>p</i> < 0.05); a marked increase in sarcoplasmic evaginations (<i>p</i> < 0.001); a substantial enlargement of the belly sarcomere (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and proximal sarcomere (<i>p</i> < 0.0001); and a notable expansion of the collagen XXII perimeter (<i>p</i> < 0.001). We concluded that the joint immobilization resulted in muscle atrophy due to disuse, which led to a decrease in sarcoplasmic projections in the MTJ, a reduction in the perimeter of collagen XXII, and, consequently, fragility of the region. Short-term training demonstrated positive effects on functional improvement, partial recovery of muscle mass, and induction of hypertrophic responses, indicating positive repercussions for the structural recovery of the myotendinous region.",

The mediating effect of AIP on BRI and CVD was also analyzed. Compared to the lowest tertile of BRI, participants with higher BRI levels had a higher proportion of females, smokers, drinkers, and individuals with lower educational attainment. Poverty-income ratio (PIR) and AIP levels were significantly higher, and the prevalence of CVD was also higher. BRI and AIP were both independent risk factors for CVD, with AIP having a significant mediating effect between BRI and CVD.

Landmark analyses further revealed a sustained increase in mortality risk associated with lower TWA-Hb during the 28-day to 1-year follow-up period. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified low TWA-Hb as an independent predictor of mortality risk at 90 days (<i>P</i> = 0.026), 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.023), and 1 year (<i>P</i> = 0.021). Each one-unit increase in TWA-Hb was associated with a 0.93-, 0.76- and 0.71-fold decrease in the risk of 90-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality, correspondingly. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, BMI, and comorbidities consistently supported these findings (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Low TWA-Hb is associated with long-term mortality in patients with AMI-CS. These findings imply that the application of this indicator in clinical practice could improve long-term risk stratification.",

      "content": "Encapsulation technology can intensify AD to facilitate the separation of the solids retention time from the hydraulic retention time (HRT), offering lower HRTs, smaller reactors, and high effluent quality. To support successful deployment, however, the encapsulated community must contain all the needed microorganisms for successful treatment and be flexible enough to treat a variety of wastewaters. Here, a two-stage system was investigated in which microbial cultures were enriched on various high-strength wastewaters in suspended flow-through systems to determine how feed type influenced performance and microbial community structure. The hypothesis was that specific genera, or so-called \"keystone species\" would positively correlate to organic carbon degradation for a given feed, enabling construction of a well-functioning community for encapsulation. Results showed that the number of total bacteria (as 16S rRNA gene copies) did not correlate to soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) removal, indicating that the community structure and/or members were important for good performance. Results also showed that feed type strongly influenced carbon removal and microbial community structure for 1st-stage fermenting communities, but not 2nd-stage methanogenic communities. In this study, the \"core\" community members were defined as organisms common to all of either the 1st- or 2nd-stage reactors irrespective of the feed they received and were present in at least 50% of the samples throughout the entire experiment. \"Unique\" community members were specific to a single feed, and hence, only present in either the 1st- or 2nd-stage reactors receiving that feed. In both 1st- and 2nd-stage communities, only one core genera and no unique genera were positively and significantly correlated to sCOD removal. Verification experiments performed with encapsulated communities showed that organisms identified in flow-through system and correlated with carbon degradation, though not significantly, seemed to be important for performance. Our results suggest that one cannot construct a community containing specific populations in lieu of enrichment. Nevertheless, a single diverse encapsulated anaerobic community should provide good (>80%) carbon removal when fed a variety of influents, if time is provided for enrichment after deployment.",

      "content": "The purpose of this study is to understand the antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular distribution characteristics of carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) in the region, and to evaluate their correlation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate the transmission status of these strains. A total of 150 CRKP collected from January 2019 to December 2021 in the Ningbo region were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution method following CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2023). The tested agents included: (1) basic antimicrobials (tigecycline, polymyxin B, ceftazidime-avibactam); and (2) combination therapy candidates (ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefepime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime). Resistance genes were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to analyze the molecular characteristics and evolutionary trends of the strains to determine their clonal relationships. The 150 strains of CRKP exhibit high resistance rates to various conventional drugs; The sensitivity rates to tigecycline, polymyxin B, and ceftazidime-avibactam were 98.7, 98.0, and 68%, respectively; Conversely, the sensitivity rates to fosfomycin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol were 72.0, 40.0, and 16.7%, respectively; The main proportions of carbapemen genes producing in CRKP are as follows: <i>KPC-2</i> (61.3%), <i>NDM-5</i> (14.7%), <i>IMP-4</i> (8.0%), <i>OXA-232</i> (6.0%), and <i>OXA-181</i> (1.3%); The main proportions of β-lactamase resistance genes are as follows: <i>CTX-M-1</i> (13.33%), <i>CTX-M-3</i> (25.33%)<i>, CTX-M-9</i> (17.33%)<i>, CTX-M-14</i> (34.67%)<i>, SHV-1</i> (26.66%), <i>SHV-11</i> (66.66%), <i>SHV-12</i> (18.66%), and <i>SHV-28</i> (10.00%); CRKP carrying class A, B, and D carbapenemases had a sensitivity rate greater than 96% for tigecycline and polymyxin B, while their sensitivities to ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam, and amikacin varied significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Analysis of the MLST results for CRKP revealed that ST11 strains were predominant in the region. There was a significant difference in the resistance genes carried by ST11 strains compared to non-ST11 strains. While different healthcare institutions exhibited variations in ST types, the strains generally showed high homogeneity. In the region, CRKP showed high sensitivity to tigecycline, polymyxin B, ceftazidime-avibactam, fosfomycin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol. The main carbapenemase genes identified were <i>KPC-2</i> and <i>NDM-5</i>. The inhibitory effects of ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam, and amikacin varied for CRKP carrying different enzyme types.",

The effects of culture age, pH (optimal at 10-11), and tetracycline as a secondary stabilizer were examined. Tetracycline accelerated AgNP formation in dark conditions but could not fully substitute light-induced reduction. The synthesized AgNPs and tetracycline-assisted AgNPs (Tetra-AgNPs) were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, EDX, XRD, FTIR, TEM, and Zeta potential measurements, confirming their crystalline, spherical, and moderately stable properties. Biological assays showed strong antibacterial activity at 10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, though Tetra-AgNPs did not outperform AgNPs or tetracycline alone, suggesting structural incorporation of tetracycline. Both AgNPs and Tetra-AgNPs showed similar antioxidant activity. These findings support the potential of <i>G. emersonii</i> KNUA204 for dual biomass utilization, integrating biofuel production with nanomaterial synthesis. Further optimization of EPS composition and biosynthesis conditions could enhance nanoparticle properties for biomedical and environmental applications, reinforcing microalgae as a platform for sustainable nanotechnology.",

Core genome and pan-genome revealed that the <i>M. pneumoniae</i> genomes were classified into two distinct clades, P1-I and P1-II, each associated with a specific sequence type (ST). Most of the genomes sequenced in this study were identified as P1-I (86.96%, 20/23), contrasting with the previously reported predominance of P1-II in the area. A limited number of single-nucleotide variations were identified in the virulence-associated genes between P1-I and P1-II, leading to amino acid substitutions.

      "content": "Emerging evidence has revealed that intestinal flora dysbiosis may be implicated not only in gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies but also in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including VD. The gut-brain axis (GBA) serves as a critical bidirectional pathway through which intestinal flora influences brain physiology and function. Notably, accumulating studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in VD management via modulation of gut microbial composition. This review synthesizes current understanding of the VD- intestinal flora relationship mediated by the GBA, while systematically evaluating evidence for CHM interventions that ameliorate VD through intestinal flora regulation. These insights may offer novel perspectives and methodological approaches for both fundamental research and clinical management of VD.",

      "content": "The presence of residual TSE hazards is assessed by detection of prion infectivity or seeding activity. TSE agents or prions are challenging to inactivate completely using heat-based methods. Different TSE strains exhibit varying degrees of thermoresistance. Based on available studies at temperatures 120-134°C, the C-BSE strain is more thermoresistant than other evaluated strains. The vast majority of Category 1 ABP is rendered into 'meat and bone meal' prior to incineration/co-incineration/combustion. Scenarios involving co-incineration for cement production do not need to be considered because all ash is incorporated into the cement. It is not possible to generalise the time/temperature combinations to which Category 1 ABP are subjected across all processes. Due to the challenges in precisely measuring the temperature and residence time in industrial systems, and the wide range of system designs and operating conditions, it can only be assumed that Category 1 ABP are exposed to at least the legal requirements as determined by the conditions of the gas produced or injected into the process: 850°C for 2 s or 1100°C for 0.2 s. The limited sensitivity of the method used in a study involving C-BSE at 1000°C for 20 min prevented a conclusive exclusion of residual C-BSE prions.. Therefore, it is not possible to exclude - with high certainty (> 99%) - the presence of residual BSE/TSE hazards in ash produced from the incineration, co-incineration or combustion of Category 1 ABP. It is recommended to generate data on the actual reduction of infectivity in 'meat and bone meal' spiked with thermoresistant TSE field strains after treatment with the time/temperature combinations required by the legislation or specific industry processes.",

This population-based study elucidated the dynamic linkage between Internet use (IU) and health behaviors (HBs), particularly emphasizing the intermediary function of social participation (SP) in middle-aged and older adults (MOA) in China. Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2020. This study employed binary logistic regression to investigate the influence of IU on the HBs of MOA in China. Additionally, binary logistic and multiple linear regressions were used to test whether SP regulates the relationship between IU and HBs (i.e. nonsmoking, non-drinking, physical activity, and physical examination). Furthermore, the Karlson-Holm-Breen method was employed to assess the mediating role of SP. IU had a positive effect on nonsmoking (OR: 1.113, <i>p</i> < 0.05), physical activity (OR: 1.775, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and physical examination (OR: 1.226, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, this study revealed that IU had a significant negative effect on non-drinking (OR: 0.775, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, the mediating effect analysis demonstrated that SP played a mediating role in the relationship between IU and the HBs. Active engagement in social activities is an effective method for enhancing the positive impact of IU on the adoption of physical activity and physical examinations. In order to meet individuals' needs, it is essential to design and promote Internet health services and social activities tailored to their age group and cultural background.",

This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of DHIs in supporting LBP self-management in workplace environments. It examines intervention components, tailoring methods, integration with occupational health (OH) pathways, and their impact on clinical and work-related outcomes. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines. Randomised controlled trials evaluating DHIs for workplace LBP were included. Data extraction focused on intervention characteristics, tailoring approaches, and primary outcomes, including pain intensity, disability, and physical performance. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias and GRADE frameworks. Five studies were included, featuring DHIs delivered via web-based platforms or mobile applications. Interventions incorporated exercise, ergonomics education, and work activity modification. Only one study used a tailored approach based on theoretical frameworks and individualised work classifications. Moderate-quality evidence supported improvements in pain, disability, and physical performance, but effects on quality of life, psychosocial factors, and work outcomes were inconsistent. Integration with occupational health pathways was absent in all studies. The lack of tailoring and integration within occupational health systems limits the scalability and impact of DHIs for workplace LBP. Future research should focus on personalised, theory-driven interventions and systemic alignment with occupational health policies to enhance their feasibility, implementation, and long-term outcomes.",

We report a case of a 54-year-old female with recurrent headache, blepharoptosis, hearing loss, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Blood tests, and serum levels of IgG4 were within normal ranges. Contrast enhanced cranial MRI revealed thickening and enhancement of bilateral cerebral hemispheres and tentorial dural maters. Additional findings included mild left lacrimal gland enlargement, bilateral middle ear mastoiditis, and tympanic tegmen destruction. Abdominal high-resolution computed tomography (CT) showed enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Histopathology demonstrated dense lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic infiltration with 80 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field and an IgG4<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sup>+</sup> cell ratio of 20%. An initial diagnosis of possible IgG4-RD was made. However, the patient's symptoms responded poorly to prednisolone (20 mg/day), and fever ensued. P<i>seudomonas aeruginosa, nocardia malleis</i>, and <i>leptocyclus virus</i> were found in the cerebrospinal fluid measured by NGS. Subsequent laboratory testing showed positive p-ANCA and anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (anti-MPO), with a negative anti-nuclear antibodies panel, leading to a revised diagnosis of MPO-ANCA-associated HP. Treatment was escalated to intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg/day), cyclophosphamide, and anti-infectious agents, leading to improved symptoms and decreased inflammatory markers. However, there was a recurrence during the taper of prednisolone. The addition of rituximab achieved complete remission. MPO-ANCA-associated HP is a rare inflammatory disorder that brings diagnostic challenges and requires comprehensive differential diagnosis. In relapsed or refractory cases, rituximab may be a valuable therapeutical option.",

      "content": "The CAC model was induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). The rats were randomly divided into normal, model and HPM groups. The tumorigenesis, number of tumors, and tumor diameter were observed. Immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the microvessel density (MVD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). The three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs with superior fluorescence-preserving capability (FDISCO) tissue clearing technique was used to clear colon tissues, and the platelet endothelial cells were stained and labelled with platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). Imaris software was used to perform 3D measurement and analysis of the colonic vascular architecture. The HPM group were found decreased in the colon tumor diameter, MVD, ROS, HIF-1α, VEGFA, VEGFR1, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in colon tissues compared with those in the model group. 3D imaging revealed that the number of vessels, number of branch points, and vessel branch level in the HPM group were lower than those in the model group. The number of branch points and vessel branch level were negatively correlated with the average vessel length. HPM plays a role in inhibiting CAC angiogenesis. This study may provide new evidence at the macroscopic level of vascular architecture for HPM to inhibit the progression of CAC by FDISCO tissue clearing technique for 3D imaging.",

      "content": "One hypothesis is that early catalysts began to prune the chemical landscape in a manner that facilitated the emergence of modern-day enzymes. As enzymes frequently rely on the intrinsic reactivity of metal ions, it follows that these early catalysts may have been metal ions coordinated to prebiotic peptides that have remained as core structures within extant proteins. Here, we demonstrate that UV light directly selects for the types of metal-binding peptide motifs found in biology. This is because bare cysteine is much more susceptible to photolysis than cysteine bound by a metal ion. Therefore, peptides with greater affinity for environmentally available metal ions, such as Fe<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, are more stable. Our results are supported by mass spectrometry, calorimetry, X-ray absorption, NMR spectroscopy, transient absorption pump probe spectroscopy, and excited-state quantum-chemical calculations. Photostability arises from the ability of the metal ion to engage transiently generated reactive radical centers in a manner that prevents subsequent degradative processes. The data are consistent with the enrichment of a restricted set of high affinity, extant-like metallopeptides in surficial environments on the early Earth.",

This development marks an important milestone in broadening the application of enzyme-like catalytic nitrite reduction across various fields, such as biomedicine, biosensing, food science, and environmental science. In this review, we first outline the different types of NiRs, along with their active center structures and catalytic mechanisms, drawing from recent research and discoveries. We then classify the reported NiR mimic materials, discussing their active center structures and enzyme-like catalytic mechanisms. Additionally, we explore the potential future applications and challenges facing NiR mimics in the field of biomedicine.",

Patients with NAFLD have an increased risk of liver-related and overall mortality. While the trials to assess the efficacy of the medications are ongoing, lifestyle modification is the first line of therapy recommended. The primary aim of this review paper is to synthesize literature related to current evidence-based lifestyle interventions for preventing and managing NAFLD. The review and synthesis of the literature reveal that personalized nutritional, exercise, and behavior change interventions are effective in managing NAFLD. Evidence suggests that there are several gaps in managing NAFLD. The gaps discussed in this paper include a lack of awareness of the disease, ineffective patient-provider communication, shortage of specialists, under-recognition of the disease, and liver health disparities. This paper highlights the evidence-based opportunities to overcome those gaps, such as utilizing comprehensive models of care, clinical care pathways, and clinical practice guidelines. Primary care physicians and endocrinologists, who are the first point of contact must utilize these opportunities for diagnosing and managing patients with NAFLD.",

However, individual responses to rTMS are variable, and its underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. As synaptic dysfunction is one of the key mechanisms associated with cognitive deficits in dementia, we investigated the effect of rTMS on cortical synapses using an APP/PS1 amyloidosis mouse model of AD crossed with fluorescent reporters linked to the Thy-1 promoter. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging, we characterized the plasticity of excitatory <i>terminaux</i> (TB) and <i>en passant</i> (EPB) axonal boutons at 48-h intervals for 8 days on either side of a single session of rTMS.",

Following stimulation, the TB, but not EPB, dynamic fraction increased in both WT and APP/PS1 groups.

The mean age of this cohort was 57 years, 50% were male, and 81% were White. The group consisted of 17 liver transplant recipients (40.5%), 13 heart transplant recipients (31.0%), and 12 lung transplant recipients (28.6%). Among the 12 lung transplant recipients, 8 received basiliximab induction, and 4 received no antibody induction therapy. 97% of the patients received mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone, while 3% received steroid-free maintenance. The median follow-up was 51.5 days (interquartile range 16-233). During this period, six individuals developed CRBSI, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.86 infections per 1,000 catheter-days. No deaths were attributed to CRBSI. Our findings suggest that intense immunosuppression in the setting of SOT is not associated with an increased risk of CRBSI in patients with renal failure utilizing TDC especially when a consistent and standardized protocol for the access and care of these catheters is utilized.",

      "content": "The intricate fibrillar composition of ECM is crucial for its viscoelastic properties, which regulate intracellular signaling and provide structural support for cells. Naturally derived biomaterials such as fibrin and collagen replicate these fibrillar structures, but longitudinal confocal imaging of fibers using fluorescent dyes may impact cell function and photobleach the sample long before termination of the experiment. An alternative technique is reflection confocal microscopy (RCM) that provides high-resolution images of fibers. However, RCM is sensitive to fiber orientation relative to the optical axis, and consequently, many fibers are not detected. We aim to recover these fibers. Here, we propose a deep learning tool for predicting fluorescently labeled optical sections from unlabeled image stacks. Specifically, our model is conditioned to reproduce fluorescent labeling using RCM images at 3 laser wavelengths and a single laser transmission image. The model is implemented using a fully convolutional image-to-image mapping architecture with a hybrid loss function that includes both low-dimensional statistical and high-dimensional structural components. Upon convergence, the proposed method accurately recovers 3-dimensional fibrous architecture without substantial differences in fiber length or fiber count. However, the predicted fibers were slightly wider than original fluorescent labels (0.213 ± 0.009 μm). The model can be implemented on any commercial laser scanning microscope, providing wide use in the study of ECM biology.",

Following Biden's inauguration, vaccine refusal declined more in pro-Biden states. Distrust in government and vaccines accounted for approximately 80% of the interstate variation. County-level analysis revealed that for every 1 percentage point increase in Trump's vote share over Biden's, counties experienced an additional 0.515%-2.674% decline in vaccination rates among adults aged 65+.",

      "content": "Lung transplantation (LTx) offers a last resort for patients battling end-stage lung disease. Even though short-term survival has improved, these patients still face several long-term challenges, such as chronic rejection and ischemic bronchial anastomosis. In lung transplant recipients, the bronchial anastomosis is prone to complications-such as poor wound healing, necrosis, stenosis, and dehiscence-due to the marginal blood supply at this site. During peri-LTx, hypoxia and ischemia stimulate fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines at anastomotic sites, leading to abnormal collagen production and excessive granulation, which impair wound healing. Despite meticulous techniques, bronchial anastomosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among lung transplant recipients. After LTx, most bronchial complications are attributed to ischemic insult since normal bronchial blood flow is disrupted, and bronchial revascularization usually takes two to four weeks, making the anastomotic bronchial vessels dependent on pulmonary artery circulation.",

In the context of LTx, mouse tracheal models are essential tools for studying bronchial complications, particularly ischemia, fibrosis, and stenosis, as well as evaluating potential therapeutic interventions. A well-established mouse model of orthotopic tracheal transplantation (OTT) mimics the anastomosis of the bronchi and the subsequent microvascular injury, providing a pathological correlation with anastomotic complications. A series of previous studies using the OTT model explored the microvascularization, ischemia-reperfusion, airway epithelial injury, and fibrotic remodeling effects after airway anastomosis. This review describes OTT as a model of airway anastomotic complications, which is crucial for understanding the immunological and molecular pathways as seen in clinical bronchial anastomoses, as well as improving anastomotic healing and reducing complications through targeted therapeutic strategies.",

Despite these insights, significant challenges remain, including the incomplete understanding of specific immune evasion pathways and the lack of personalized therapeutic strategies. To address these gaps, this review introduces a novel \"Trinity\" regulatory network of immune evasion in HNSCC, encompassing: (1) metabolic reprogramming-mediated immune checkpoint modulation, (2) stromal cell-driven immune dysfunction, and (3) epigenetic remodeling fostering immune tolerance. This framework provides a theoretical foundation for the development of multi-targeted combination therapies and offers innovative strategies to overcome immune evasion. Additionally, this review systematically synthesizes the current understanding of the relationship between the HNSCC microenvironment and immune escape, with a focus on emerging immunotherapeutic approaches such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy. Leveraging cutting-edge single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we elucidate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the HNSCC immune landscape and propose a new paradigm of \"lineage plasticity-driven immune adaptation.\" These insights not only advance our understanding of HNSCC biology but also pave the way for the development of precision immunotherapies aimed at improving patient survival and quality of life. By integrating multidisciplinary perspectives, this work underscores the importance of targeting the TME to achieve durable clinical responses and overcome immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.",

A suite of computational models was employed to assess TIIC signature scores and to refine the selection of prognostic TIIC-related genes using multiple machine learning techniques-including Random Survival Forest (RSF), LASSO regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression, among others. In addition, pathway enrichment, immune signature difference analyses, and immunotherapy response predictions were performed. Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets were identified through differential gene analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and copy number variation (CNV) landscape comparisons between high and low TIIC groups. We identified 137 significant TIIC-RNAs within the CRC microenvironment and developed a prognostic model based on five key TIIC-RNAs. This model, which leveraged machine learning methods such as RSF, LASSO, and Cox regression, demonstrated outstanding performance in survival prediction across TCGA-CRC and external validation datasets, outperforming 22 existing prognostic models. Furthermore, the high TIIC score group showed heightened expression of angiogenesis-related genes, whereas the low score group was enriched for immune response-associated genes. The TIIC signature score was significantly correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, various metabolic characteristics, and chromosomal instability, and it effectively predicted immunotherapy response across diverse cancer types. The findings of this study highlighted the promise of the TIIC signature score in forecasting the outcomes for CRC patients. Additionally, it emphasized its utility in predicting the effects of immunotherapy, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the intricacies within the tumor microenvironment. Further research needs to concentrate on assessing the clinical utility of the TIIC signature score while also confirming its relevance across various populations and treatment contexts.",

Subcutaneous (SC) C1INH replacement therapy is approved for LTP in patients with HAE (age indication varies between countries). There is little real-world data on the outcomes of patients who switch to C1INH SC in Europe, particularly those who switch from C1INH IV. This retrospective patient chart analysis captured real-world evidence of the effectiveness of C1INH SC LTP in patients with HAE in Germany (n=69) and Spain (n=37). The primary endpoint was change in annualized attack rate (AAR) in patients who used C1INH IV LTP during a 6-month baseline period and switched to C1INH SC LTP for ≥6 months. Switching to C1INH SC LTP from C1INH IV LTP was associated with a 73.2% reduction in AAR (n=48; P<0.001) compared to baseline. Emergency Room (ER) visits and rescue medication use were also significantly reduced after switching to C1INH SC LTP from C1INH IV LTP. A similar reduction in AAR (68.9%), ER visits (49.8%), and rescue medication use (61.9%) was observed in the overall population (n=105), regardless of treatment at baseline.",

Among the included subjects, 2/3 of whom were randomly imported into the training set for calculating the optimal proportion of GWG ranges, and another third of the women were imported into the validation set to evaluate the GWG ranges calculated with different methods. The detection rate of adverse outcomes of pregnant women with appropriate weight gain proportion under the above three methods was evaluated by paired chi-square test, using the data of pregnant women in the validation database. According to the percentile method, the suitable proportion of GWG of pregnant women with underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity before pregnancy was 25.8%-37.8%, 20.3%-30.8%, 13.0%-23.1%, respectively. According to the Odds ratio method, the suitable proportion of GWG for pregnant women with different BMI categories was 24%-34%, 14%-18%, and 4%-14%, respectively. According to the combined risk curve method, the suitable proportion of GWG for pregnant women with different BMI categories was 27.9%-32.5%, 11.5%-16.8%, and -2.1%-5.5%, respectively. When the proportion of GWG ranges from 27.9%-32.5%, 11.5%-16.8%, and -2.1%-5.5% for different BMI categories, the pregnant women with appropriate weight gain proportions have the lowest detection rate of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. The GWG proportion serves as a valuable clinical indicator for enabling personalized weight management strategies and tailored nutritional guidance during pregnancy. The recommended proportion of GWG in this study for underweight, normal, overweight, and obese pregnant women was 27.9%-32.5%, 11.5%-16.8%, and -2.1%-5.5%, respectively.",

We employed three statistical models-a generalized linear regression model, a weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression model, and a Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model. We included 834 CKD participants finally. In the generalized linear regression model, the prevalence of CVD was higher in individuals with MiBP (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.08-3.18; P for trend = 0.022), MCNP (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.18-2.91; P for trend = 0.011), MBP (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.02-2.76; P for trend = 0.041) and MECPP (OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.28-3.86; P for trend = 0.008) in the highest tertile compared to those in the lowest tertile. In the WQS model, the WQS index was significantly positively associated with CVD (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.04-1.99; <i>p</i> value = 0.028). Among the ten phthalates, MCNP showed the highest weight (weighted 0.21). A positive link between phthalate mixture exposure and cardiovascular disease was also demonstrated by the BKMR model. The conditional posterior inclusion probabilities (condPIPs) obtained from the BKMR model indicated that MCNP and MECPP were the primary contributors to the overall effect observed in the group, with condPIP values of 0.581 and 0.508, respectively. The results indicated that phthalate exposure was linked to an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and highlighted the need to reduce plastic use among the CKD population.",

A total of 609 policies were retrieved, among which 1,072 entries mentioned VI-HQMR. Results showed that the VI-HQMR included 482 symbiotic units, 549 symbiotic models, 383 symbiotic environments and 96 symbiotic interfaces. Secondary and above public hospitals and PHC institutions are the most important symbiotic units. Medical alliances are the most important symbiotic model. The symbiotic environment includes policy, technology and economics. The vertical integration of human resources is the main symbiotic interface. The VI-HQMR is still in the initial exploration stage. The symbiotic model is changing from parasitism to the commensalism. To achieve the optimal mutualism model, we need to work hard from the symbiotic environment. Health administrative department should coordinate with other relevant departments to introduce special policies to support the VI-HQMR.

Demographic and clinical information of PTB patients from 2014 to 2022 in Guangzhou were extracted from the PTB Information Management System (TBIMS). Diagnosis delays were categorized as patient delay (>30 days from symptoms onset to first care-seeking) and hospital delay (>14 days from first care-seeking to TB diagnosis). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for these delays.

Overall, 44.39% patients experienced a diagnosis delay, comprising 27.90% with patient delay and 29.09% with hospital delay, with both showing a gradually declining trend over time. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed risk factors for diagnosis delay including female sex, older age, ethnic minority status, migrant status and re-treated patients, which were similar to patient delay. Risk factors for hospital delay included, passive case finding, and re-treated patients. Notably, sputum smear-positivity was positively associated with both the diagnostic delay (aOR 1.279, 95% CI: 1.224-1.335) and patient delay (aOR 1.642, 95% CI: 1.563-1.724), but reduced the risk of hospital delay (aOR 0.906, 95% CI: 0.866-0.950). Public health strategies should prioritize improving bacteriological detection rates among migrants, with targeted efforts for high-risk groups such as females, the older adult, and ethnic minorities.",

We analyzed 2,157 severe COVID-19 cases (aged ≥50) reported to the Centre for Health Protection from the hospital authority-managed public hospitals between January 30, 2023, and January 29, 2024. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between vaccination status and fatal outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and residential status in residential care homes for the older adult (RCHE), and other demographic factors. Among the 2,157 cases, 764 (35.4%) succumbed within a 28-day follow-up. Fatal outcomes were more common among older individuals, RCHE residents, and those unvaccinated or with incomplete initial vaccination (zero to two doses). Fewer deaths had received ancestral strains mRNA or inactivated booster doses compared to those not receiving booster. Univariate logistic regression revealed the lowest in-hospital mortality odds ratio for mRNA booster recipients, followed by inactivated booster recipients, and then those with completed initial vaccination (three doses). After adjusting for confounders, booster vaccination remained significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality.",

To investigate the determinant factors, we applied multilevel statistical analysis. Among 1,246 currently breastfed children aged 6-23 months, based on a 24-h recall method, it showed that 1,066 (85.56%), 550 (44.15%), 1,025 (82.24%), and 1,098 (88.09%) of children had inadequate minimum dietary frequency, minimum meal frequency, minimum milk feeding frequency, and minimum acceptable diet, respectively. The multilevel analysis revealed that individual-level factors, such as mothers with primary, secondary, and higher educational levels, middle and richest household wealth, children aged between 12-17 and 18-23 months, received a postnatal check, and having one and three antenatal care follow-up had lower odds of feeding their children with inadequate minimum acceptable diet than their counterparts. At the zonal community level, children residing in urban areas and children residing in zonal communities with a high literacy level were less likely to have inadequate minimum acceptable diet. There is a high magnitude of inadequate minimum acceptable diet intake among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. Mother's education, household wealth, marital status, number of families, age of child, postnatal check, community-level education, living in rural areas, and number of people under the age of 5 were significant factors of inadequate minimum acceptable diet. The findings highlight that, to increase the minimum acceptable diet intake in Ethiopia, policymakers and other stakeholders need to prioritize enhancing household wealth status and improving the accessibility of education.",

These adaptive responses are orchestrated through a multifaceted cellular program involving the concerted action of diverse stress response pathways, including antioxidant responses, DNA repair mechanisms, molecular mechanisms for intracellular signaling leading to proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, and cell cycle regulation. These cell defenses suggest that humans can adjust to moderate levels of stress or change without experiencing negative effects, implying the existence of a threshold dose. Likewise, reported no-observed adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) for various asbestos fiber types and asbestos-related cancers in experimental and epidemiological data further support the existence of a threshold dose and are discussed here.",

In total, 13 studies were included, revealing 5 key themes: (1) Limited vaccine literacy influences adolescents' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines; (2) Family, peers, and community strongly influence adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine decision-making; (3) Different levels of trust in vaccine providers and governments influence adolescents' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines; (4) Desire to go back to normality influences adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine attitudes towards vaccine acceptancy; (5) Autonomy influences adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine decision-making. The review findings suggest that vaccine acceptance among adolescents could be improved through tailored and accessible vaccine literacy messaging, addressing structural mistrust, and empowering adolescents to make autonomous health decisions that take into account diverse contexts and populations. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024512197, identifier CRD42024512197.",

This study aimed to quantify historical trends (1990-2021) in the global burden of self-harm across genders, age groups, and regions, and project future changes (2022-2050) through Bayesian forecasting models. Based on the seven GBD super-regions, the burden of self-harm was analyzed by region, age, and gender from 1990 to 2021. Hierarchical statistical approach was used to predict trends in global and regional changes in the burden of self-harm, 2022-2050. In 2021, the global DALYs and death counts from self-harm were 33.5 million (95% UI: 31.3-35.8) and 746.4 thousand (95% UI: 691.8-799.8). The region with the highest number of DALYs and deaths is South Asia and the highest age-standardized rates of DALYs and mortality were in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia. Globally, the burden of self-harm was higher for males than for females. DALYs rates were highest among adolescents and young adults (20-29 years), whereas mortality rates showed a predominantly age-progressive pattern with the highest burden observed in middle-aged and older populations, albeit with a modest decline in the oldest age groups. Forecasting models showed a sustained decline in the global burden of self-harm from 2022-2050.",

A multidisciplinary approach involving nurses and other healthcare team members, particularly physicians, is essential for comprehensively addressing pressure injury (PI) in medical wards. Therefore, this study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and barriers among physicians working in Jordanian general medical wards toward the prevention of pressure injury. A descriptive correlational cross-sectional design was employed, utilizing a convenience sample of 73 physicians from the three largest governmental hospitals in Jordan, representing the country's most populated regions. A self-administered questionnaire measuring knowledge, attitudes, and barriers was distributed among the study population. Descriptive statistics, including mean (M) and standard deviation (SD), were used to analyze the total scores, while a linear multiple regression model was applied to identify factors influencing knowledge, attitudes, and barriers toward pressure injury prevention in Jordanian medical wards. The study found that physicians demonstrated good knowledge but exhibited weak attitudes and recognized significant barriers toward pressure injury prevention.",

The study used a disproportionate cluster sampling method to obtain data. The research sample consisted of 259 primary school teachers randomly selected from 35 primary schools in Şanlıurfa. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted. ResultsUpon examination of the structural model that produces the best-fit values, it is evident that teacher-school fit has a positive impact on both teachers' job satisfaction and psychological ownership levels. Furthermore, job satisfaction has a positive effect on teachers' participation in decision-making and psychological ownership. Finally, it is worth noting that both psychological ownership and participation in decision-making have a negative impact on organizational exclusion. The negative impact of organizational ostracism is mediated by job satisfaction and psychological ownership, which are both affected by teacher-school fit. Specifically, the teacher-school fit has a negative effect on organizational ostracism through the full mediating effect of job satisfaction and participation in decision-making. ConclusionTeachers' fit to their schools increases their job satisfaction, participation decision-making, psychological ownership, and decreases their ostracism.",

Twenty-one studies comprising 59,975 participants were included in the meta-analysis. A significant nonlinear relationship was observed between the number of childhood adversities and the risk of future psychosis experiences (<i>p</i> for nonlinearity = .021). The pooled odds ratio for psychosis increased from 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-2.22) for 1 exposure to 6.46 (95% CI: 4.37-9.53) for 5+ exposures compared to no traumatic experience. This meta-analysis provides robust evidence for a dose-response relationship between cumulative childhood adversity and psychosis risk, with nonlinear patterns suggestive of an accelerating, more pronounced, risk at higher levels of trauma exposure. These findings underscore the importance of considering childhood traumatic experiences as a putative and potentially causative risk factor for psychotic experiences, as well as early prevention and intervention efforts targeting childhood adversity to reduce the risk of psychosis.",

However, there are currently no established guidelines for managing asymptomatic moyamoya disease because of the lack of sufficient information regarding its clinical features, prognosis, and treatment strategies. To address these issues, we conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study, the Asymptomatic Moyamoya Registry(AMORE), in Japan. The interim analysis of the AMORE revealed that affected hemispheres may carry a 1.0% annual risk of stroke, mainly hemorrhagic stroke, in asymptomatic moyamoya disease. Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis was found to be an independent predictor of stroke, whereas microbleeds and Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis were independent predictors of hemorrhagic stroke.",

Of note, this variant is also associated with intracranial arterial stenosis that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for MMD, as well as with systemic vascular conditions such as non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Despite its strong association with the disease, the p.

In parallel, researchers have examined the clinical relevance of <i>RNF213</i> variants other than p. Arg4810Lys and have identified rare mutations that may contribute to disease severity. Moreover, large-scale genetic analyses have identified additional susceptibility genes, such as DIAPH1 and ANO1, whose roles in MMD pathogenesis remain under investigation. Although substantial advances have been made in elucidating the genetic architecture of MMD, the precise mechanisms underlying disease onset remain elusive and represent an important area of ongoing research.",

STA-MCA bypass prevents cerebral ischemic attacks by improving cerebral blood flow. Recent evidence further suggests that direct revascularization reduces the potential risk of rebleeding in patients with MMD with posterior hemorrhage who have an extremely high annual rebleeding rate. Despite the favorable long-term outcomes of STA-MCA bypass, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a potential complication of this procedure that can result in focal neurologic deficits and/or delayed intracerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, recent guideline recommendations indicate that STA-MCA bypass is a reasonable choice for symptomatic patients with MMD, together with intensive perioperative care for blood pressure control.",

      "content": "However, over-sedation can cause side effects, including iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS). The use of nurse-led analgesia and sedation protocols may improve patient outcomes. The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine whether the use of such protocols can reduce opioid and benzodiazepine doses. Secondary outcome measures included documentation of pain and sedation scores, incidence of IWS, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and PICU/hospital length of stay (LOS). A systematic review of the literature was conducted, searching several databases, including CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete and Cochrane Library. Pertinent articles were selected according to pre-determined eligibility criteria. The internal validity of included studies was assessed using validated critical appraisal tools for quantitative research from the Cochrane Library. Narrative synthesis was utilised for data analysis due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics. Nurse-led protocolised sedation significantly reduced the administered doses of benzodiazepines and the incidence of IWS. Moreover, the use of protocols significantly improved the documentation of pain and sedation scores across included studies. No significant difference in opioid use, duration of MV, and PICU/hospital LOS has been found. However, sub-group analyses for duration of MV and PICU/hospital LOS showed positive results in older children and those post-cardiac surgery. Nurse-driven analgesia and sedation protocols can reduce over-sedation and IWS in critically ill children. Further studies should explore the use of protocols in patient sub-groups where positive results have been reported. Nurse-led analgesia and sedation protocols in PICU can improve outcomes and reduce costs. Effective implementation requires training and audits to boost nurses' confidence and autonomy.",

      "content": "Research has provided substantial insights into the immunological and oxidative processes affected by temperature. However, our understanding of the complex interplay in mosquito-pathogen interactions remains limited. In this study, we investigated the impact of temperature on alternative splicing in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (adult females) under different thermal conditions. Few genes exhibited differential alternative splicing when comparing low (20°C) and high (36°C) temperatures to standard rearing conditions (28°C). Among these, Trypsin (TRY), Ferritin (FER), Thioredoxin (TRX) and Peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC) were identified, aligning with previous findings that their expression is temperature-sensitive. Among the genes identified with alternative splicing, we focus on Thioredoxin and PGRP-LC, genes modulated by temperature variations and promising targets for future studies on their role in the competence of Ae. aegypti to transmit Zika. Experimental validation confirmed that TRX, a gene critical for pathogen defence, has a differentially spliced exon under warmer conditions, potentially altering its activity. In contrast, no differential splicing was observed for PGRP-LC across temperature treatments. These findings suggest that temperature-induced alternative splicing may play a role in shaping the mosquito's physiological responses to environmental changes, highlighting a previously underexplored layer of complexity in mosquito-pathogen dynamics.",

However, the literature on healthcare architecture rarely considers how the physical environment may contribute to these outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> This review systematically searched five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework guided the keywords selection. <b>Results:</b> The review included 15 articles. The role of the physical environment on IHTs for ICU patients was grouped into categories including ICU patient rooms, corridors, elevators, receiving departments, unit layouts, and overall hospital layouts. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings suggest that optimizing environmental design can significantly enhance patient and staff safety, and transport efficiency. Future research should focus on addressing the identified gaps, employing more robust methodologies, and exploring innovative design solutions to improve IHT outcomes in ICU settings.",

However, the confinement of this spinodal decomposition process to emulsion droplets typically produces porous particles with a dense silica shell that blocks pore accessibility. Here, we address this issue by controlling the interfacial energies of the two phases undergoing spinodal decomposition within the emulsion droplet. We use surfactant mixtures to induce neutral wetting to prevent shell formation and generate particles with fully open, accessible and interconnected pore systems. Lattice Boltzmann simulations corroborate the experimental findings and underline that neutral wetting conditions with a contact angle to the continuous phase of ∼90° for both phases are essential to form open surface pores. Our work provides a simple strategy for producing hierarchical porous particles with controlled surface and bulk porosity between ∼200 and ∼6000 nm, expanding their potential for applications in catalysis, separation technologies, and adsorption.",

A total of 1902 outpatients with type 2 diabetes from a regional hospital and a primary care facility were included in this prospective study. Baseline plasma PCSK9 was measured by immunoassay. CKD progression was defined as a composite of incident end stage kidney disease (ESKD, sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, maintenance dialysis or renal death) or doubling of serum creatinine. A total of 226 renal events were identified during a median of 7.2 years of follow-up. The Cox regression model showed that one standard deviation (SD) increment of plasma PCSK9 was associated with a 1.27 (95% CI 1.10-1.48) fold increased risk for the composite renal outcome after adjustment for known cardio-renal risk factors. As a categorical variable, participants with PCSK9 in the top tertile had a 1.47 (95% CI 1.02-2.12) fold adjusted risk for the renal outcome compared to those in the lowest tertile. Consistent data were obtained when ESKD was taken as the study outcome or non-renal death was taken as a competing risk. A high level of plasma PCSK9 is independently associated with an increased risk of CKD progression, suggesting the need to further elucidate the role of PCSK9 in diabetic kidney disease. Future studies are warranted to explore whether PCSK9 is a potential target for prevention and treatment of kidney disease.",

Because the gut microbiota influences drug efficacy and IBD-patient microbiota presents increased bacterial abundance, we investigated the impact of candidate Enterobacteriaceae on drug cytotoxicity, metabolism and efficacy. Thiopurines were exposed in vitro to bacteria for 4 h at 37°C and drug concentrations measured by UV spectrophotometry. Cytotoxic effects and drug metabolite concentrations on NALM6 and JURKAT cells were determined after treatment with thiopurines exposed or not to bacteria. Drugs were measured in Klebsiella pneumoniae lysates and bacterial conditioned media were used for metabolomic analyses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on eight IBD-patient faecal stools. Incubation of thiopurines with K. pneumoniae, but not Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, reduced thiopurine concentrations and cytotoxicity on NALM6 and JURKAT cells. Thiopurine metabolites were lower in cells treated with drugs previously exposed to K. pneumoniae. Internalisation of drugs was demonstrated by their detection in lysates after bacterial incubation. Untargeted metabolomics revealed biotransformation of thiopurines by K. pneumoniae, as reactions of deconjugation, reduction, glycosylation, acetylation or conjugation with propionic acid.",

Previous studies have reported moderate stereoselectivity for various aminoacyl-RNA transfer reactions. Here, we examine aminoacyl-RNA loop-closing ligation, a reaction that \"captures\" aminoacylated RNA in a stable phosphoramidate product, such that the amino acid bridges two nucleotides in the RNA backbone. We find that the rate of this reaction is much higher for RNA aminoacylated with L-amino acids than for RNA aminoacylated with D-amino acids. We present an RNA sequence that nearly exclusively captures L-amino acids in loop-closing ligation. Finally, we demonstrate that ligation of aminoacyl-L-RNA results in an inverse stereoselectivity for D-amino acids. The observed stereochemical link between D-RNA and L-amino acids in the synthesis of RNA stem-loops containing bridging amino acids constitutes a stereoselective structure-building process. We suggest that this process led to a selection for the evolution of aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozymes that were selective for L-amino acids, thereby setting the stage for the subsequent evolution of homochiral peptides and, ultimately, protein synthesis.",

Despite their potential, atomic-level high-entropy nanozymes have not been reported due to thermodynamic instability. Therefore, developing atomic-level high-entropy nanozymes are of great significance. What's more, further exploring their biomedical applications can open up new horizons for nanozymology. Here, the atomic-level high-entropy nanozyme system capable of remarkable endogenous targeted catalysis and enhancing tumor photothermal therapy is successfully constructed. The system is prepared by reduction-diffusion and grafting methods. The RuRhPtIrMo sub-nanometer high-entropy nanozyme (snHEAzyme) with about 8-10 atoms thickness is first prepared. Then, they are grafted by targeting agent DSPE-PEG2000-cRGD and imaging agent Cy7 to obtain the snHEAzyme@DSPE-PEG2000-cRGD@Cy7 nanozyme system. The synthesized snHEAzyme@DSPE-PEG2000-cRGD@Cy7 system exhibits excellent peroxidase-like activity and high absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) range. Under NIR irradiation, the nanozyme shows efficient photothermal conversion and reactive oxygen species generation effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the snHEAzyme@DSPE-PEG2000-cRGD@Cy7 system can be effectively targeted to penetrate tumor cell membranes and treat tumors. This work offers a new perspective on snHEAzyme fabrication and its biomedical applications.",

A second study employed four nonvasectomized, singly housed males to determine if the physiologic effects observed in the first study could be due simply to the increased cage size due to pairing. Results indicated that pair-housing with a female resulted immediately in a significant increase in blood pressure, body temperature, and heart rate. Over the course of a week of being paired, the males showed a significant decline in blood pressure; body temperature remained elevated, though at a lower level than during the immediate response. The second study suggested that increased cage size alone could not account for the immediate results in Experiment 1, inasmuch as no effects were found on our measures. Although the sample sizes for the studies were small, we discuss how our results are similar to, and differ from, previous studies, as well as the clinical significance and welfare implications.

This exceptional adhesion is attributed to the formation of covalent-like Cu─C bonds while preserving its sp<sup>2</sup> structure, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the corrugated structure of MAC facilitates the hybridization of C 2p<sub>z</sub> orbitals with Cu 4s and 3dz<sup>2</sup> orbitals, promoting strong bonding. These insights indicate that the amorphous structure of MAC significantly enhances adhesion while preserving its elemental composition, providing a pathway to improve the mechanical reliability and performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials on metal substrates in various technological applications.",

Qualitative questions gathered information on perceived challenges with patient connectivity and patient-level barriers associated with RM implementation. A total of 339 responses from 302 unique centres were included in the analysis. Respondents most often were cardiac electrophysiologists (57.8%), followed by nurses (17.1%) and nurse practitioners (7.7%). Most respondents (84.7%) reported at least one challenge in daily RM management. The biggest challenge was the increasing data volume and data variability (38.3%), followed by staff shortage (33.8%), difficulties with billing for technical activities (20.2%), and insufficient RM reimbursement (16.0%). Patient connectivity was identified as a major barrier by 72.7% of respondents. The main concerns were patient literacy (80.8%), followed by a lack of patient understanding of RM importance (65.8%), the lack of required bandwidth or technology to support RM (49.6%), and the cost to the patient (47.9%). Subgroup analyses showed that patient connectivity was often identified as a major barrier by non-MD CIED clinic staff, respondents working in office-based CIED clinics, and respondents from clinics with a per-patient payment reimbursement model. There are many patient-related barriers identified by non-MD CIED clinic staff. Dedicated strategies to optimise the utilisation and adherence of RM of patients with CIEDs are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes.",

Moreover, the closed-form Laplace transform of the model facilitates the quantification of Kendall's tau measure of dependence. The frailty model's parametric and flexible parametric variants are examined. For parameter estimation, the expectation-maximization technique is employed, taking advantage of the hierarchical representation of the frailty distribution, providing a simpler and more stable method than directly maximizing the observed log-likelihood function. The performance of the estimators is assessed numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. We apply our methodology to two medical datasets on cancer. The results indicate the benefits of the proposed model over existing frailty models in the literature. The implementation of the procedure is added to the R package extrafrail.",

This can be accounted for by the charge trapping/de-trapping operation strategy of current heterostructure design, which results in less practicality and infeasibility for nonvolatile memory technology. In this work, a giant leap in erasing voltage down to -12 V and high on/off ratio of 8.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> under the low biases is revealed, originating from the mediation of interfacial dipolar coupling between 0D carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and 2D fluorine-functionalized graphene (f-Gra). Such 0D/2D interfacial circumstance, rather than intuitive charge transfer, introduces confined potential wells that immobilize the electrons: at adjacent CQDs the conduction-band offset prevents the electrons from returning to unoccupied valence states of CQDs, and near f-Gra the insulating F─C bonds negate further electron transport. Investigations on visualizing the interfacial physics of 0D/2D carbon-based designs, underscoring the performance improvement based on post anneal treatment, and unveiling the ternary buffering functionality in optical-signal processing, are anticipated to pave the keen step for the strategical designs of advanced optoelectronics.",

      "content": "AI is too heterogeneous and dynamic to circumscribe fixed paths along which it must operate-and, in any event, the benefits of the technology proceeding along novel pathways would be limited if rigid, prescriptive regulatory barriers were imposed. But this does not mean that AI should be left unregulated, as the harms from irresponsible and ill-managed development and use of AI can be serious. Instead of \"guardrails,\" though, policymakers should impose \"leashes.\" Regulatory leashes imposed on digital technologies are flexible and adaptable-just as physical leashes used when walking a dog through a neighborhood allow for a range of movement and exploration. But just as a physical leash only protects others when a human retains a firm grip on the handle, the kind of leashes that should be deployed for AI will also demand human oversight. In the regulatory context, a flexible regulatory strategy known in other contexts as management-based regulation will be an appropriate model for AI risk governance. In this article, we explain why regulating AI by management-based regulation-a leash approach-will work better than a prescriptive or guardrail regulatory approach. We discuss how some early regulatory efforts include management-based elements. We also elucidate some of the questions that lie ahead in implementing a management-based approach to AI risk regulation. Our aim is to facilitate future research and decision-making that can improve the efficacy of AI regulation by leashes, not guardrails.",

The resulting cardiomyopathies impact fish stock in terms of mortality, quality, growth performance and economic loss. Diagnosis of these diseases is currently based on clinical signs, histopathology and RT-qPCR. To identify putative biomarkers for use in the health assessment of Atlantic salmon, a quantitative proteomics investigation was undertaken with the aim of differentiating fish with CMS from healthy fish and fish with PD. Serum samples (n = 9/group) were collected during health assessment from pens where clinical CMS or PD were present and compared to serum from healthy Atlantic salmon. There were 34 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in CMS compared to healthy, 66 comparing CMS to PD, and 81 comparing PD to healthy. In relation to healthy samples, most DAPs were shared between CMS and PD, with higher relative abundances observed in PD. An exception to this was serum fibrinogen, which was identified as a putative biomarker for CMS, whereas differentiation of Atlantic salmon with CMS from those with PD was enhanced by the calculation of the ratio of fibrinogen to skeletal troponin C.",

These isoforms contribute to key neuronal processes by modulating protein interactions and signaling pathways. Recent advances in visualization techniques, such as biosensor-based live imaging and SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling, have provided new insights into the spatial distributions and dynamic behaviors of PI isoforms in neurons, particularly at synapses. However, significant questions remain, such as how specific PI isoforms coordinate signaling events in distinct subcellular compartments and how these lipids influence critical neuronal processes like vesicular trafficking and synaptic plasticity. Addressing these challenges will require the continued development of advanced imaging technologies, which are essential for mapping nanoscale distributions of PIs and their dynamic roles in neuronal processes. Here, I will review current findings, advancements in visualization methodologies, and key research directions. This review will be helpful for understanding the roles of PIs in neuronal physiology, their broad impacts on neuronal signaling, and the technological breakthroughs needed to uncover these complex processes.",

      "content": "In addition, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended by the ACC Expert Consensus for patients receiving DOAC. To determine the risk of clinically important thromboembolic and bleeding events and death in patients concomitantly prescribed DOACs and PPIs compared with DOAC alone. We undertook a population-based cohort study of Ontario residents aged 66 years or older who were newly dispensed a DOAC from 2009 to 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of clinically relevant bleeding, thrombotic events, and all-cause death. We then used a time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the adjusted hazard of outcomes during time periods where patients were exposed vs not exposed to PPI. We included 283 771 new DOAC users (mean age 78.3 years, 49.4% female). The age/sex-standardized outcome event rate of the composite outcome was higher in the DOAC-PPI cohort [20.2 (95% CI 20.0-20.5) per 100 person-years] than in the DOAC-alone cohort [15.2 (95% CI 15.1-15.4) per 100 person-years]. In time-dependent Cox regression analyses examining time periods during DOAC-PPI co-therapy vs DOAC alone, risks were elevated for all outcomes during periods of PPI co-therapy, suggesting residual confounding. In a secondary analysis of patients receiving DOAC-PPI co-therapy (n = 115 493), periods of DOAC-PPI co-therapy were associated with a greater hazard for death (HR 2.24, 95% CI 2.14-2.35), but a lower risk for both thrombosis (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96) and clinically relevant bleeding (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.81). Our cohort study of older adults suggests that DOAC-PPI co-therapy is associated with decreased upper GI bleeding but increased mortality. Since the implications are major and may be due to residual confounding, we recommend that the findings be verified in randomized trials before clinical application.",

      "content": "However, its impact on treatment resistance in BPPV patients remains unclear and understudied.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study investigated the association between treatment resistance in BPPV and various risk factors, including vitamin D deficiency, age, gender, and comorbidities.&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A retrospective review of medical records was conductedon 122 patients diagnosed with BPPV at a tertiary care hospital between January2020 and January 2023. The diagnosis of BPPV was confirmed using clinical historyand positional tests, while serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were measured usingchemiluminescence immunoassay. Patients who required three or more canalithrepositioning maneuvers were considered treatment-resistant. Logistic regressionanalysis was employed to assess the impact of demographic and clinical factors onBPPV treatment resistance, and recurrence rates were evaluated over a one-yearfollow-up period.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Logistic regression revealed that male gender, comorbidities, and betahistine use were significantly associated with BPPV resistance (p &lt; 0.05), while no significant relationship was found between vitamin D levels and treatment resistance or recurrence (p &gt; 0.05). Recurrence was observed in 22.1% of patients during the follow- -up period, though this was not significantly related to vitamin D status.&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; While previous studies suggested a potential link between vitamin Ddeficiency and BPPV recurrence, this study found no significant association betweenvitamin D deficiency and resistance along with the recurrence of BPPV. Instead, malegender, comorbidities (notably hypertension), and betahistine use were identified asrisk factors for requiring multiple maneuvers. The study raises questions about therole of vitamin D in BPPV pathophysiology and suggests that other clinical factorsmay have a greater influence on treatment outcomes.",
